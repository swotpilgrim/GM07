# Chapter 10: La Casa de Los Perdidos

Dale Porter had lived in the desert all his life.

Born at Laguna Pueblo, raised between two worlds—indigenous tradition and American modernity—he'd learned early that some knowledge didn't translate. Couldn't be explained in English, couldn't be measured by Western science, couldn't be dismissed just because it defied logic.

His grandfather had taught him about thin places.

Now, sitting in the shadow of his tow truck while the afternoon heat pressed down, Dale looked at the four people depending on him for answers. Victor, still clinging to rationality despite overwhelming evidence. Grace, her academic framework cracking. Ricky, hollowed by war and open to impossible truths. Denise, trapped for thirty years in something she couldn't explain.

They needed framework. Context. Understanding.

"My grandfather," Dale began, "was born in 1893. Died in 1974. Ninety years watching this desert, learning its patterns. He told me things the tribal elders knew, things that went back centuries before the Spanish came, before Route 66, before any of this." He gestured at the diner.

"He called certain places 'La Casa de Los Perdidos.' The House of the Lost Ones. Not specific buildings—places. Locations where the world is thin."

"Thin," Grace repeated, notebook out, documenting. "You've mentioned that. What does it mean?"

Dale chose words carefully. "The boundary between what is and what was. Between living and dead. Between time flowing forward and time... not flowing. In most places, those boundaries are solid. You're alive or you're dead. Time moves one direction. But in thin places, the rules break down."

He looked at the diner, chrome glinting in harsh sunlight. "This spot is one of them. Has been for a very long time, longer than any diner. My grandfather said the Navajo and Apache both avoided this area. No good hunting, no water, but that wasn't why. The place felt wrong. Animals stayed away. People who camped here had bad dreams, saw things that shouldn't be."

"Supernatural," Victor said. Skepticism still there, but weakened.

"Western word," Dale said. "We just called it a thin place. Acknowledged it existed, avoided it, left offerings if we had to pass through. Respect for things older than us."

Ricky lit a cigarette. "But someone built a diner here."

"1948," Dale confirmed. "Earl and Dotty Higgins bought this land cheap—nobody wanted it. Built their diner with their own hands. My grandfather warned them, but they were white settlers chasing the American dream. Didn't listen to indigenous superstition."

"What happened?" Grace asked.

"They prospered. For seven years, business was good. Route 66 was booming, travelers needed food and gas, Earl and Dotty were friendly and competent. Everything normal." Dale paused. "Then August 1955, grease fire. Building burned to the ground. Earl and Dotty died—smoke inhalation, trapped in the kitchen."

"We've seen the death certificates," Victor said.

"Then you know it's documented. Official. Two people died, two people buried at Carlsbad Cemetery. The diner was destroyed—foundation, walls, everything. Insurance paid out. Land sat empty."

"But," Grace prompted.

"But three months later, travelers started reporting a diner on this stretch. Open for business, Earl and Dotty serving food. Authorities investigated—found no structure, no permits. Dismissed as travelers misremembering locations. But reports continued. My grandfather drove out here in early 1956. The diner was back. Exactly as it had been. And Earl and Dotty were working, unchanged, like they'd never died."

"The thin place," Denise whispered. "It brought them back."

Dale nodded. "Thin places require certain things to maintain boundaries. My grandfather's teaching said they need... purpose. Intention. Usually tied to death—someone dying there gives the place power, anchors it. Earl and Dotty died running a diner. That became their eternal purpose."

"Time loop," Grace said, working it through. "They're caught in the moment of their purpose, repeating it forever."

"Or they've become extensions of the place itself," Dale offered. "My grandfather wasn't sure. Indigenous metaphysics doesn't separate entity from location the way Western thinking does. Earl and Dotty might be ghosts operating independently, or they might BE the diner now, consciousness and place merged."

Victor shook his head. "This is insane."

"Is it?" Dale met his eyes. "You've seen the fingerprints. Watched people vanish leaving no tracks. Seen Earl and Dotty work for hours without rest. At what point does evidence overrule assumption?"

"People don't come back from the dead."

"Usually, no. But in thin places, different rules."

Ricky spoke up. "In Vietnam, I saw villages that weren't there the next morning. Enemy soldiers who disappeared mid-combat. Real things operating under rules I didn't understand. Military explained it as stress, hallucination. But too many of us saw the same things." He drew on his cigarette. "Some places don't follow normal physics. War taught me that."

Grace was scribbling notes furiously. "If it's a time loop, why does time flow normally for us? We're experiencing days, hunger, fatigue. Linear time."

"Because you're not part of the loop," Dale said. "You're visitors. The place affects you, but you're not bound to it. Yet."

The word hung heavy.

"Yet," Denise echoed. "I thought I was just visiting. Thirty years ago, I pulled in for a waitress job. Temporary, save money for California. Then I saw them kill someone, tried to leave, and—" Her voice broke. "I can't. I wake up back here. Always. I'm caught."

"Different than Earl and Dotty," Dale said gently. "They're bound by death and purpose. You're bound by... I don't know. Witness, maybe. The place needs you to serve, so it keeps you."

"Can it be broken?" Victor demanded. "Thin place, time loop, whatever—can we destroy it?"

Dale considered. "My grandfather said thin places are older than human civilization. You can't destroy geography. But you can starve them. They feed on certain things—death, usually. Fear. Repetition of purpose."

"Thirty-seven murders over twenty-seven years," Grace said. "That's feeding it."

"Maybe. Or maybe Earl and Dotty kill because that's what they've become—predators wearing human memory. The place might not care about the murders. Might just need the diner function, the serving, the eternal routine."

"Which means stopping Earl and Dotty might not stop the place," Ricky said.

"Might not."

They sat in silence, absorbing that. The desert wind whispered through scrub brush. Heat shimmered. The diner stood perfect and impossible, chrome glinting.

Victor stood abruptly, paced. "Okay. Okay. Let's say all of this is real. Thin place, time loop, death-bound ghosts or whatever. How do we survive it? How do we get out?"

"My grandfather never said," Dale admitted. "His advice was simple: don't go there. Once you're in a thin place, you're in its domain."

"People must've escaped," Grace said. "Travelers passing through over the years. They didn't all die."

"Earl and Dotty are selective," Denise said. "They let most people go. Only kill the ones who won't be missed—drifters, runaways, people with no connections. I've watched them serve hundreds of people safely. Just... smile, cook, send them on their way."

"So we're not automatically dead," Victor said. "We just need to convince them we're not good targets."

"We broke into their freezer," Ricky pointed out. "Found their victims. They know we know. Selection criteria might not matter anymore."

Dale looked at the diner. "There's another possibility. The 1955 fire destroyed the diner, killed Earl and Dotty. The place brought them back. But fire weakened it—that's why the diner sat empty for three months. Maybe fire is the weakness."

"Burn it again?" Victor asked.

"Would it work? Or would the place just rebuild like before?"

Grace was staring at her notes. "In your grandfather's teaching, what ends a thin place?"

Dale thought back to lessons learned in childhood, stories told on winter nights. "He said thin places fade when they're forgotten. When nobody remembers them, nobody visits, they lose power. Eventually the boundary solidifies again, becomes normal geography."

"But that takes generations," Grace said.

"Usually."

"We don't have generations."

"No."

Ricky crushed out his cigarette. "So our options are: convince Earl and Dotty we're not worth killing, burn the diner and hope it doesn't rebuild, or wait generations for it to fade. None of those help us."

"There's a fourth option," Dale said quietly. "Survive until someone else arrives. Another traveler, highway patrol, anyone. More witnesses make it harder for thin places to function. They operate in isolation, in forgetting. Documentation and outside attention weaken them."

"Grace has been documenting everything," Victor said. "Photos, notes, evidence."

"Which helps. If we can get that documentation out, show it to authorities, create official investigation—that's attention, memory, the opposite of forgetting."

"If we get out," Ricky emphasized.

Dale nodded. "If."

The sun was descending toward the mesas. Evening approaching, then night. Another cycle of phantom customers, Earl and Dotty's routine, the diner's supernatural pulse.

Denise hugged her knees tighter. "I tried to document things. First few years, I wrote down everything—dates, victims, details. Hid the notes. But they always disappeared. The place erases evidence. Only things that survive are what Earl and Dotty want—the trophies, the photos on the wall."

"My documentation is still intact," Grace said. "In my van, my notebooks."

"For now," Denise said softly. "But if the place decides you're not leaving, it'll erase what it wants erased."

Victor looked at Dale. "Your grandfather avoided this place. But you came here. Why?"

"You needed help. Your truck broke down. I'm a mechanic." Dale shrugged. "And I thought... maybe I'm protected. Indigenous, aware of what this is, respectful. Maybe the place would let me pass."

"Has it?"

Dale met his eyes. "Don't know yet. My truck's sabotaged like yours. Might be I'm as trapped as you."

"Shit."

"Yeah."

They sat watching the diner as shadows lengthened. Five people caught in a thin place where time looped and the dead served dinner and geography didn't follow rules.

Grace closed her notebook. "We need Denise's full story. Everything she's seen in thirty years. Patterns, weaknesses, anything that might help."

"Tomorrow," Victor said. "Tonight we fortify, stay armed, survive. Tomorrow we gather intelligence and plan."

"And if Earl and Dotty come for us tonight?" Ricky asked.

Dale pulled a pouch from his jacket—leather, beaded, worn smooth. "My grandfather gave me this. Protection charm. Said it wouldn't stop thin places, but it might slow them down, give warning." He opened it, revealed dried herbs and small stones. "Creosote, sage, desert rose. I'll make a circle around our camp. Won't trap them, but they'll know we're aware. That we're not ignorant victims."

"Will it work?" Victor asked.

"Worked for my grandfather. Lived to ninety."

It was thin reassurance. But better than nothing.

As darkness fell and the neon "EAT" sign flickered to life, pulsing red against the black, Dale began his circle of protection.

And inside the diner, Earl and Dotty moved through their eternal routine.

Dead twenty-seven years.

Serving forever.

In a thin place where the desert made its own rules.
