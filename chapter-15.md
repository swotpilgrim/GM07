# Chapter 15: Evidence of Sabotage

Victor had examined engines his entire adult life. Twenty years on the road. Knew their rhythms, their logic, how they failed and why.

This wasn't failure. This was murder.

Pre-dawn light gave just enough visibility for inspection. He lay under his Peterbilt with Dale's flashlight, documenting what Earl had done.

The fuel line cut was surgical. Not torn or cracked from age—sliced clean with a sharp blade. Professional work. Someone who understood engines well enough to disable without destroying.

"Here," he called to Dale. "See this?"

Dale slid under beside him. Victor indicated the cut.

"Clean edge. Single stroke. Earl knew exactly where to cut for maximum effect with minimum visibility."

They examined further. The distributor cap hadn't just been removed—it had been hidden. Victor found it wedged into the engine compartment's far corner, carefully placed where casual inspection wouldn't spot it.

"He wanted it to look like random breakdown," Dale said. "Not obvious sabotage."

"Yeah. Makes the victim think it's bad luck, not attack. Keeps them cooperative while he processes them."

The battery was worse. Terminals corroded with acid—not natural wear. Someone had deliberately applied corrosive substance, let it eat through connections. The backup battery showed the same treatment.

Victor slid out from under the truck, checked Grace's VW van. Same pattern. Fuel line cut, distributor hidden, battery sabotaged. Methodical, professional, thorough.

Dale's tow truck showed identical work. Three vehicles, three perfect sabotage jobs, all done in one night while they slept.

"He did all three vehicles in one night," Victor said. "While we slept. Moved between them silently, disabled each one, left no trace of his presence."

"Experience," Dale said. "Sixty years of this. He's perfected the methodology."

Victor walked the perimeter, looking for additional evidence. The sun was rising now, light strengthening from gray to gold, revealing details the flashlight had missed. Found tire tracks—boot prints, actually. Work boot pattern, size 12, deep tread. Heavy impressions in the gravel and sand, weight distributed forward like someone moving with purpose. Matched Earl's visible footwear—Victor had noticed the old man's work boots yesterday, steel-toed Redwings that looked older than they should be.

The prints led from diner to each vehicle and back. A clear trail of intent.

"We can cast these," he said. "Plaster casts, prove Earl approached the vehicles night of sabotage. Physical evidence linking him to the scene."

"You thinking like a prosecutor," Dale observed.

"Thinking like someone who wants to make sure this holds up in court. If we get out, I want these bastards buried properly—legally, officially."

Grace appeared with her camera, hair pulled back, Pentax already raised. She photographed the prints from multiple angles, the sabotage, the correlation between Earl's boots visible through the diner window and the prints in the gravel. Building evidence, layer by methodical layer. The anthropologist in her knew documentation was survival.

Victor continued examining his truck. The damage was reversible—with proper parts and tools, he could fix everything in maybe four hours. But parts were fifty miles away. Tools were limited. And they didn't have four hours of safety.

He moved to the truck bed, inventoried what he had:

Emergency supplies: flares, first aid, water purification tablets, road maps.
Tools: basic socket set, wrenches, duct tape, electrical wire.
Cargo: transmission parts bound for Phoenix (useless for current vehicles).

Not enough to effect repairs. But enough for other purposes. Victor's mind shifted from mechanic to tactician. In the Army, before trucking, he'd learned to improvise weapons from civilian supplies. A road flare could become an incendiary device. Electrical wire could restrain or create tripwires. Even transmission fluid, in the right circumstances, burned hot and long.

"Dale," he called. "Your truck have any acetylene? For welding?"

"Tank's half full. Why?"

"Thinking about fire. If we need to burn something." Victor met his eyes. "Destroy evidence, create distraction, or—worst case—deny them the hunting ground."

Dale's expression darkened. "The diner."

"Maybe. Last resort. But having the option matters. Control of the battlefield includes scorched earth if necessary."

"That's extreme."

"So is thirty-seven murders. I'm thinking tactically—every option on the table, prioritized from best to worst. Fire's at the bottom. But it's there."

They worked in silence as dawn broke fully. Victor cataloguing evidence, Dale gathering supplies. Grace documenting everything on film.

Ricky appeared, knives sharpened, ready for combat.

"Findings?" he asked.

"Professional sabotage. Earl's work. Boots match, technique matches Denise's description of his skillset. He's a mechanic, knows engines. Used that knowledge to trap us."

"Can you reverse it?"

"Given time and parts, yes. Without either, no."

"So we're still trapped."

"Physically. But we have evidence now. Proof this was deliberate attack, not random mechanical failure. That matters for prosecution."

Victor showed Ricky the photographs Grace had taken. Cut fuel line close-up. Battery corrosion. Boot prints leading to and from vehicles. Distributor cap hidden.

"Legal case?" Ricky asked.

"Stronger. Proves criminal intent, assault, unlawful imprisonment. Add to the freezer evidence, victim documentation, this becomes airtight. If we get it to authorities."

"Big if."

"Yeah."

They returned to the group, gathering behind the vehicles where Denise waited in the shade. Victor spread his documentation across the van hood beside Grace's victim photos. Boot print photographs next to freezer documentation. Sabotage evidence next to victim identification. Dale's ground-penetrating scan printouts showing thirty-seven burial sites.

The complete picture emerged like pieces of a puzzle snapping into place: Thirty-seven murders spanning decades, methodical victim selection criteria, professional sabotage trapping travelers, systematic processing turning people into trophies, and a geographic location that bent reality's rules to enable it all.

"This is everything," Grace said, arranging the materials with academic precision. "We have motive, means, opportunity, evidence, witness testimony. If this was normal serial killer case, we'd have everything needed for conviction."

"But it's not normal," Victor said.

"No. Earl and Dotty died in 1955. Legal system doesn't handle undead defendants."

Denise spoke from her position in the shade. "Does it matter? If you prove the murders happened, if you identify victims and let families bury them properly—isn't that justice enough?"

Grace considered. "Yes. Actually, yes. The goal isn't punishing Earl and Dotty. It's giving victims' families closure."

"Then focus on that," Denise said. "Document the dead. Map the graves. Prove the murders. Let authorities decide how to handle the impossible parts."

Smart. Practical. Victor nodded.

"Okay. Today we finish documentation. Tomorrow dawn, we execute Ricky's plan—restrain Earl and Dotty, signal for help. When authorities arrive, we hand over complete evidence package. They excavate, identify remains, notify families. Earl and Dotty become problem for federal investigators to figure out."

"What if authorities don't come?" Dale asked.

"We keep signaling until someone does. Smoke fires by day, flares by night. Eventually someone investigates."

"And if Earl and Dotty attack before then?"

"We fight. That's why we've been drilling."

The sun climbed higher. Heat built. They worked through morning, finalizing preparations.

Victor made repairs where possible—couldn't fix vehicles but could weaponize supplies. Flares became potential fire starters. Electrical wire became restraints. Road maps became documentation of distances, proving how isolated they were.

Grace organized evidence into categories: victims, methods, timeline, location, supernatural elements. Built narrative that could survive legal scrutiny.

Dale performed final ground scans, mapping burial sites precisely. GPS coordinates, depth measurements, spatial relationships. Gave authorities everything needed for excavation.

Ricky drilled combat formations again. Tightening response times, smoothing coordination.

Denise watched through windows, ready to call warnings if Earl and Dotty moved differently.

By afternoon, they'd achieved maximum readiness. The heat had built to its daily peak, shimmering waves rising from chrome and gravel, making the desert horizon waver like a mirage. But their preparations were solid—weapons distributed, evidence organized, plans rehearsed.

"Tonight we rest," Victor announced, voice carrying command authority he hadn't used since Army days. "Weapons close, formations memorized. Tomorrow dawn, we execute."

They gathered supplies, established defensive position behind the vehicles. Protected from direct view of the diner windows, able to see both entrances, grouped for mutual support. Victor positioned the trucks to create a natural fortification—metal walls against attack, shade against sun, psychological barrier between them and the diner's pull.

As sunset approached, Victor stood watching the diner. Chrome glinting orange-red in dying light, the building's curved surfaces catching fire from the western sky. The neon "EAT" sign dormant, waiting for darkness to pulse it to life with that bloodred glow.

Sixty years this place had operated. How many victims beyond the thirty-seven documented? How many families never got answers, never stopped hoping their missing loved ones might still be alive somewhere?

Tomorrow, that ended. One way or another. Either they'd stop Earl and Dotty, escape with evidence, bring closure to decades of disappearances—or they'd join the frozen gallery in the walk-in, become photos on the wall, echoes drifting through phantom nights.

Earl and Dotty appeared in the window, moving through their routine. Victor watched them with new understanding. Not mysterious supernatural entities—just killers. Unusual killers, impossible killers, but killers nonetheless. And killers could be stopped.

The evidence was ready. The documentation complete. The weapons distributed. The plan formed.

All variables accounted for except one: would they survive to deliver evidence?

Victor touched the crowbar leaning against the truck. Solid metal, satisfying weight. Simple tool transformed into weapon by necessity. He'd never imagined using it for combat, but then again, he'd never imagined fighting undead serial killers in a desert trap either. Life kept surprising you—usually in unpleasant ways.

He'd survived twelve years on the road through blizzards, mechanical failures, sketchy truck stops, and highway predators both human and animal. He'd navigate this too. Different terrain, different enemy, same principle: adapt, survive, keep moving forward.

Behind him, the others prepared for the night. Ricky checking knife edges one more time. Grace organizing evidence into waterproof bags—protecting documentation even if they didn't survive to deliver it. Dale performing some kind of blessing ritual over their defensive perimeter, traditional words in a language Victor didn't know but respected. Denise simply watching, hope and fear balanced in her expression.

As darkness fell and the neon sign flickered to life—red pulse in desert black—Victor settled in for final night watch. The "EAT" sign glowed like a warning, like a threat, like a promise broken sixty years ago and repeated endlessly since.

Tomorrow, they'd take back control.

Tomorrow, they'd fight.

Tomorrow, thirty-seven victims would finally get justice, and thirty-seven families would get answers.

He just had to survive until dawn. Keep everyone alive through one more night. Then execute the plan—restrain Earl and Dotty, signal for help, hand over evidence, let the impossible become someone else's problem.

One more night.

He could do that.

Had to do that.

Because the alternative—becoming victim thirty-eight—was unacceptable.
