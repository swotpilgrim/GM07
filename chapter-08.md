# Chapter 8: Trapped

"We leave now," Victor said.

Nobody argued.

They moved as a group—Victor, Grace, Ricky, Dale—out to the parking lot where their vehicles sat baking in the late-morning heat. Denise followed, moving like someone in a dream, or a nightmare she'd been trapped in for thirty years.

Victor reached his Peterbilt first. Climbed into the cab, turned the key.

Nothing. Not even a click.

He climbed down, popped the hood. The fuel line he'd suspected was cut—he could see it now, a clean slice through the rubber tubing. But worse: someone had pulled the distributor cap, and the battery terminals were corroded white with what looked like deliberately applied acid.

Professional sabotage. Thorough, methodical, designed not just to disable but to make repair time-consuming.

"Shit."

Grace was at her VW van. "Mine won't start either."

Dale was already underneath his tow truck, examining. He slid out, face grim. "Battery's dead. Spare's dead too. Cables cut."

They stood in a loose circle, the reality settling over them like the desert heat.

"The payphone," Grace said.

Victor had tried it yesterday. Tried it again now anyway, lifting the receiver. No dial tone. Dead line. He checked the cord—cut, hidden behind the booth where it wouldn't be immediately visible.

Fifty miles to the nearest town. East or west, didn't matter—both were impossibly far.

"We walk," Ricky said. He was already thinking tactically, Victor could see it. "Early morning, late evening, avoid midday heat. Two days, maybe three. Carry water, ration food."

"August in New Mexico," Dale said quietly. "A hundred-plus degrees by noon. We'd need gallons of water per person, per day. The diner has maybe two gallons total."

"Then we make it in one push," Ricky insisted. "Carry everything we can, move fast."

"Fifty miles?" Dale shook his head. "Loaded down, in heat? We'd be lucky to make twenty before we collapsed. Then we're dying in the desert instead of here."

The math was brutal and unavoidable. Walking out meant death by exposure. Staying meant—Victor looked at the diner, at the freezer he knew was inside, at the thirty-seven bodies.

Staying meant joining them.

"There has to be another option," Grace said. She was pacing, thinking frantically. "Someone will come by eventually. Another traveler, highway patrol—"

"How much traffic have you seen on this road?" Dale asked. Not unkindly. "I drove past this stretch maybe once a month when the diner was empty. Since Earl and Dotty... since they came back, I avoid it entirely. Most locals do."

"Came back?" Victor repeated. "From being dead?"

"From whatever they are now." Dale looked at the diner. "That building burned to the ground in 1955. I've seen the photos. But it rebuilt itself. And Earl and Dotty with it."

Denise was sitting on the ground, knees pulled to her chest. "No one comes," she said softly. "Not by accident. Only people who are lost. Only people the diner wants."

"The diner doesn't want anything," Victor said. "It's a building. Earl and Dotty are murderers, but they're human. They can be stopped."

"They're dead," Denise said. "They've been dead for twenty-seven years. You can't stop what's already dead."

Ricky crouched beside her. "You said they can be hurt. That means they can be fought. Dead or alive, if they bleed, they can be stopped."

Victor examined his truck more carefully, trying to think practically. The sabotage was thorough—fuel line, distributor, battery. With the right parts and tools, he could fix it in maybe six hours. But the parts were in towns fifty miles away, and Dale's truck—the only vehicle that could fetch parts—was equally sabotaged.

A perfect trap.

He walked the perimeter of the diner, looking for something they'd missed. A radio, another phone, a vehicle hidden somewhere. Found nothing but desert and silence.

The garage beside the diner was empty except for basic tools—wrenches, jacks, oil. No spare parts. No communication equipment. The CB radio Dale mentioned was there, but when Victor powered it on, nothing but static. He tried multiple frequencies, called for help, got only white noise in response.

Like the world outside had stopped existing.

"Could be atmospheric," he muttered. "Solar activity, interference—"

But he didn't believe it.

Grace was photographing the sabotaged vehicles, building documentation. Ricky had moved to high ground—a small rise near the parking lot—scanning the horizon with combat-trained eyes.

"Movement," Ricky called. "Diner."

They all turned.

Earl and Dotty had returned. They were visible through the plate-glass windows, moving through their routine. Earl at the grill, Dotty wiping tables. Perfect synchronization, like nothing had happened. Like Victor hadn't forced open their freezer full of bodies an hour ago.

"They're just... cooking," Grace said, disbelief in her voice.

"They're always cooking," Denise said. "Always serving. That's what they do. That's all they are now—the diner's function, running on loop."

Victor watched them move. Even from outside, even knowing what was in that freezer, they looked like a sweet elderly couple running a roadside diner. Harmless. Welcoming.

The perfect camouflage for thirty-seven murders.

"We need to think strategically," he said, forcing himself into problem-solving mode. "We can't leave, we can't call for help. So we defend this position until we can do one of those things."

"Defend against what?" Grace asked.

"Against them deciding we're next."

Ricky nodded. "Fortify, arm, prepare. We make this place secure, we don't eat or drink anything they give us, and we wait for opportunity."

"What opportunity?" Dale asked.

"Another traveler. Someone with a working vehicle, or communication equipment, or just... someone else. The diner's been here since 1955. People must stop sometimes."

"And then what?" Denise's voice was hollow. "Earl and Dotty add them to the freezer too. You've seen what happens. People come, people disappear. That's the pattern."

"Then we break the pattern," Victor said. Jaw set, refusing to accept helplessness. "We're not phantom customers. We're not drugged victims. We know what's happening. That makes us dangerous."

He looked at his companions. Grace, academic and frightened but determined. Ricky, hollowed by war but tactically sharp. Dale, resigned but knowledgeable. Denise, broken but surviving.

Not a strong team. But a team.

"Tonight we barricade the diner from inside," Victor said. "We control the space, we stay armed, we don't sleep. Tomorrow we work on vehicles—try to repair enough to get one running. If that fails, we signal for help."

"How?" Grace asked.

"Smoke fire. Visible for miles. Someone will see it."

"Or it attracts Earl and Dotty's attention," Dale said.

"They already know we know. Hiding doesn't help us now."

It was a thin plan. Lots of holes, lots of assumptions. But it was better than paralysis.

Ricky started inventorying supplies—food from the diner, water containers, anything useful. Grace continued documenting. Dale examined tools, seeing what could be weaponized.

And Victor stood watching the diner, watching Earl and Dotty move through their routine.

The freezer was in there. Thirty-seven bodies, perfectly preserved. Thirty-seven people who'd thought they were just stopping for a meal, for help, for a place to rest.

Thirty-seven people who'd been selected, processed, murdered.

He wouldn't be thirty-eight.

Movement at the diner's door. Dotty emerged, shading her eyes, looking toward them. She smiled and waved, cheerful and grotesque.

"You folks hungry? Lunch is ready!"

Her voice carried across the parking lot, bright and friendly and absolutely chilling.

Nobody moved.

Dotty's smile didn't waver. "Come on now, don't be shy! We've got burgers on the grill!"

"We're not eating your food," Victor called back.

"Oh, don't be silly. You must be starving. Come inside, we'll get you fed."

The invitation hung in the desert air. The smell of cooking meat drifted from the diner—burgers, fries, coffee. Victor's stomach growled despite everything. They hadn't eaten since the discovery, and his body didn't care about horror when it was hungry.

"No thank you," Grace said, voice shaking.

Dotty tilted her head, birdlike. "Well, the offer stands. Door's always open."

She went back inside. Through the windows, Victor watched her rejoin Earl at the grill. They moved in their perfect synchronization, their eternal choreography.

"We need our own food," Ricky said. "Water. We can't rely on anything from them."

Dale pointed east. "There's a creek bed about three miles that way. Usually dry this time of year, but might have water underneath if we dig. And desert scrub—can make a basic survival tea from creosote, keep us hydrated."

"Three miles," Victor said. "That's six miles round trip. In this heat?"

"Early morning. Before it gets hot. I'll go."

"Not alone," Ricky said. "I'll go with you."

Victor wanted to argue—splitting up was dangerous. But they needed water. And Ricky was combat-trained, capable. Between him and Dale's desert knowledge, they had a chance.

"First light tomorrow," Victor decided. "Tonight, we stay together."

They gathered supplies from the vehicles. Victor's truck had emergency rations—dried meat, crackers, a few bottles of water. Grace had snacks for her research trips. Dale had jerky and a canteen. Combined, maybe enough for two days if they rationed hard.

Not enough.

The sun climbed higher. Heat became oppressive. The diner's air conditioning beckoned—cool refuge, comfort, food, water.

A trap baited with basic human needs.

Victor looked at the chrome building gleaming in the sun. At the neon "EAT" sign, dormant now but ready to pulse red come nightfall. At the plate-glass windows showing Earl and Dotty in their endless loop.

They were trapped. Vehicles sabotaged, communication cut, miles from help, in hostile territory controlled by killers who might not even be entirely human anymore.

But they were alive. Aware. Armed with knowledge.

And Victor Brennan had driven through blizzards, sandstorms, and three-state police chases in his twelve years on the road. He hadn't survived by giving up when things got difficult.

He wasn't starting now.

"Alright," he said. "Here's what we do."

And they began planning their survival.
