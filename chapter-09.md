# Chapter 9: Death Certificates

Grace spread the photocopies across the hood of her VW van like evidence at a trial.

Death certificates for Earl Higgins and Dotty Higgins, both dated August 17, 1955. Cause of death: smoke inhalation and burns. Burial location: Carlsbad Cemetery, plots 447 and 448. Business license from 1948 with their fingerprints on file—required for food service permits.

The afternoon heat made the documents curl at the edges. Grace weighted them down with rocks.

"We have documentation they died in 1955," she said. "Photos showing them unchanged. What we need is definitive proof."

"How?" Victor asked, crowbar across his lap.

"Fingerprints. If we lift prints from Earl and Dotty now and they match 1948 records, that's proof."

Ricky crushed out his cigarette. "Lifting prints requires powder, tape, proper technique."

"You know how?"

"Army intelligence training. Basics." He looked toward the diner. "But we need them to leave prints on something. Glass works best."

"They serve water in glasses," Denise offered quietly. She was sitting in the shade of the van, hugging her knees. "Coffee cups. They're always serving."

"We'd need to get close," Victor said. "Inside. Where they can control the space."

"Quick in, quick out," Ricky said. "Combat extraction. I go in, take a glass or cup, leave. Thirty seconds maximum."

Grace shook her head. "They'll suspect. After we broke into the freezer, they know we're hostile." She thought about it, turned to Denise. "Do they ever leave glasses or cups outside? For pickup, cleanup?"

Denise considered. "Sometimes. If customers eat outside—but we don't have customers anymore. Just you."

"Then we create an opportunity," Grace said. An idea forming. "I go in, order coffee, ask if I can sit outside. They bring it out. I leave it untouched. You—" indicating Ricky, "—retrieve it after I leave."

"They'll see you not drinking it."

"So I drink some. Just not enough to finish. I say I'm full, distracted. Then I leave the cup outside."

It was thin. But better than walking directly into a potential trap.

Victor nodded slowly. "I don't like it. But we need the evidence." He looked at Grace. "You're sure about this?"

No. But she needed proof that could stand up to scrutiny.

"I'm sure."

They prepared. Ricky gathered supplies—talc powder, packing tape, magnifying glass. Victor positioned himself outside with a clear view. Dale waited by the van.

Grace walked to the diner alone.

The bells jingled when she entered. Air conditioning washed over her, blessed relief from the heat. Earl and Dotty looked up from their stations, smiling.

"Well, hello hon!" Dotty's cheerfulness felt profane after what Grace had seen in the freezer. "Thought maybe you folks were mad at us."

"Just needed some air," Grace said, forcing her voice steady. "Actually, could I get some coffee? To go?"

"To go?" Earl's smile never wavered. "You planning to leave us?"

"No, I just—I want to sit outside. Too much time in enclosed spaces. I'm feeling claustrophobic."

A lie, obvious and flimsy. But Dotty just smiled wider. "Of course, sweetie. Black or cream?"

"Cream. Two sugars."

Dotty poured coffee into a ceramic mug—diner-standard, heavy, perfect for fingerprints. She carried it to the door, held it out.

Grace took it, careful not to touch where Dotty's fingers had been.

"You enjoy that now," Dotty said. "Let us know if you need anything else."

Grace sat at one of the outside picnic tables, the mug in front of her. The coffee smelled good—rich, dark. Her exhausted body craved caffeine.

Don't drink it. Don't trust anything they serve.

She lifted the mug, let it touch her lips, tilted it enough to wet her mouth. The coffee tasted perfect. Probably drugged.

She set it down, hands shaking.

Through the window, she could see Earl and Dotty watching. She forced herself to sit there for five minutes, staring at the desert, pretending to drink occasionally. Building the fiction of normalcy.

Then she stood, left the mug on the table, walked to the van.

"Done," she whispered.

Ricky moved immediately. Casual walk to the picnic table, like he was checking the area. Picked up the mug by the base where Grace had touched, carried it back.

Inside, Earl and Dotty continued their routine. If they noticed Ricky's retrieval, they gave no sign.

Dale had set up a workspace in his truck bed—clean cloth, magnifying equipment, good light. Ricky dusted the mug handle with talc powder, fine coating that adhered to the oils left by fingerprints.

Ridge patterns emerged. Clear, distinct whorls and loops.

"Perfect prints," Ricky said. "Multiple fingers, good definition." He pressed packing tape carefully over the powder, lifted it, transferred the prints to a sheet of white paper.

Grace pulled out her photocopies. The 1948 business license showed Earl and Dotty's fingerprints—required for health permits, officially documented, notarized.

Dale held the magnifying glass over both—the lifted prints from the coffee mug, the archived prints from 1948.

Silence.

"Well?" Victor asked.

Dale moved the magnifying glass back and forth. Comparing. Analyzing.

"It's a match," he said finally. "Not similar. Identical. Same ridge count, same pattern type, same minutiae. These are the same fingerprints."

Grace felt the world tilt. She'd expected it—the logical conclusion of all their evidence—but having it confirmed physically was different. This wasn't folklore or ambiguous photos. This was biometric proof.

"Dotty's too," Ricky said. He was examining the other prints lifted from the mug. "I got both their prints—Earl's on the mug body, Dotty's on the handle where she carried it. Both match the 1948 license."

Victor took the magnifying glass, examined the prints himself. Grace watched his face—the last bulwark of skepticism crumbling.

"This is impossible," he said quietly.

"And yet." Grace gestured at the evidence. "Documented, verifiable, impossible."

"Fingerprints don't lie," Ricky said. "Can't fake them, can't inherit them. These are the same people."

Dale was quiet, staring at the diner. "La Casa de Los Perdidos. My grandfather tried to explain, but I didn't really understand. Thought it was just stories. Warnings to keep us away from dangerous places."

"Explain now," Victor said.

Dale gathered his thoughts. "In Laguna tradition, there are places where the world is thin. Where the boundary between what is and what was breaks down. Time doesn't flow right in thin places. Sometimes it loops. Sometimes it stops. Sometimes things that died don't stay dead because they're caught in the moment of their death, repeating it forever."

"Earl and Dotty died in the 1955 fire," Grace said, working it through. "But somehow they came back. Or never left. And they've been running the diner since then, killing people, unchanged."

"Ghosts?" Victor asked. "We're saying they're ghosts?"

"Ghosts are metaphor," Dale said. "Western word for something indigenous people always knew. Some deaths don't finish. Some places hold onto the people who died there, make them act out their last moments or their purpose. Earl and Dotty's purpose was running a diner. Feeding travelers."

"And killing them," Ricky added.

"Maybe that came later. Or maybe it was always there, just hidden when they were alive. Death stripped away the pretense, left only the predation."

Grace pulled out her notebook, writing furiously. Documentation, evidence, theory. "If it's a time loop, they're trapped in 1955. That's why the diner looks frozen in that era. That's why they don't age. They're not experiencing linear time like we are."

"But we are," Victor said. "We're experiencing normal time. Days are passing."

"For us. Maybe not for them. Or maybe the thin place lets both timeframes exist simultaneously." Grace was reaching the limits of her academic framework. "I don't have the conceptual tools for this. This is physics I don't understand, reality I can't measure."

Ricky lit a cigarette, studying the fingerprints. "Can they be killed?"

Everyone looked at him.

"If they're dead already—" Victor started.

"They bleed," Ricky interrupted. "Denise said so. They can be hurt. That means they have physical forms, even if those forms shouldn't exist. Physical forms can be destroyed."

"You want to kill them," Grace said.

"I want to stop them from killing us. If that requires violence, yes."

Denise spoke from the van's shade. "They've been shot before. 1967, the bikers I mentioned. One of them had a gun, shot Earl in the chest. He bled black—not blood, something else—but he kept moving. They're hard to stop."

"Hard isn't impossible," Ricky said. Veteran's pragmatism. "Everything has a weakness. We find it, we exploit it."

Grace looked at the fingerprints. Physical evidence of impossibility.

Earl and Dotty Higgins died August 17, 1955.

And they were inside that diner right now, cooking, waiting.

"We need more information," Grace said. "About the fire. About how they died. About this place specifically—why here, why them."

"Denise knows some of it," Dale said. "She's been watching for thirty years."

"Not watching by choice," Denise said bitterly. "Imprisoned. Forced to watch every murder, every burial. Serve their last meals. Smile while they die."

Grace moved to sit beside her. "I know. And I'm sorry. But what you know—it might save us. Help us understand enough to break this."

"Nothing breaks it," Denise whispered. "The diner burned completely in 1955. Razed to the ground, Earl and Dotty buried in the cemetery. And three months later, the diner was back. Exactly as it was. And they were back. Nobody remembers it being rebuilt. It just... existed again."

"The place rebuilt them," Dale said. "The thin place needed them. Pulled them back."

Victor stood abruptly, paced. His entire worldview was rewriting itself and Grace could see the strain. "Okay. Okay. Let's say all of this is real. They're dead, the diner is some kind of supernatural trap, fingerprints don't lie. What do we DO about it?"

"Survive until morning," Ricky said. "Then reassess."

"And if they come for us tonight?"

"We fight."

Grace gathered the fingerprint evidence carefully, stored it with her other documentation. Death certificates, photographs, newspaper articles, and now biometric proof.

Everything you needed to prove the impossible.

Except it wouldn't be enough. Even with fingerprints, even with all this evidence, would anyone believe them? Or would they sound like conspiracy theorists, trauma victims, people who'd lost touch with reality?

The sun was descending toward the western mesas. Soon darkness would fall, and the neon "EAT" sign would pulse red, and the phantom customers would start arriving.

And Earl and Dotty would move through their eternal routine, serving the living and the dead with equal cheerfulness.

The same Earl and Dotty who'd died twenty-seven years ago.

Whose fingerprints proved they'd been dead all along.

Grace looked at the diner, at the evidence, at her companions.

They were trapped in a place where reality had holes in it.

And the only way out was through.
