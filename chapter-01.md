# Chapter 1: Breakdown

The Peterbilt's engine coughed twice before dying completely.

Victor Brennan guided twelve tons of truck onto the shoulder before momentum gave out. He cranked the wheel right, felt the tires grab gravel, came to rest at an angle that would make towing a pain in the ass. Heat shimmered off black asphalt in waves.

"Son of a bitch."

He'd driven Denver to Phoenix maybe two hundred times, usually on Interstate 40. This morning he'd taken Route 66 on a nostalgic whim, remembering his old man driving it back when it was still the main artery.

Apparently, what remained was nothing and a broken fuel pump.

Victor grabbed his Peterbilt cap, climbed down. August heat hit him—furnace-dry, over a hundred easy. He popped the engine compartment, stared at components he could usually diagnose by sound.

Fuel pump.

He looked both directions down Route 66. Empty. Cracked two-lane highway stretching through scrubland and dust to vanishing points. No buildings, no vehicles. Fifty miles back to the last town, maybe seventy ahead.

CB radio out of range. Payphone at the last gas station ripped out.

Victor squinted west. Something glinted in the heat shimmer, maybe two miles off. Structure of some kind. Only visible thing in any direction.

He locked the cab, started walking.

The sun drilled through his skull despite the cap. Sweat soaked his shirt within ten minutes. Stupid decision—walking into desert without water, chasing what might be a mirage.

But it was real.

The diner came into focus gradually as he closed distance. Classic 1950s roadside chrome palace: low-slung building with curved edges, stainless steel exterior reflecting sunlight like a mirror, huge plate-glass windows. A neon sign on the roof, unlit in daylight but obviously reading "EAT" in red letters ten feet tall. Gravel parking lot big enough for a dozen eighteen-wheelers. A cinderblock garage off to one side. Everything looked maintained, cared for, impossibly clean.

A time capsule, perfectly preserved.

Victor's boots crunched on gravel as he crossed the lot. A dusty Volkswagen van sat near the entrance, out-of-state plates. No other vehicles. He pushed through the glass door, bells jingling.

Air conditioning hit him like a blessing. The interior was even more pristine than the outside: checkerboard linoleum floor waxed to a gleaming shine, turquoise vinyl booths along the windows, chrome-trimmed Formica counter with red leather stools. A Wurlitzer jukebox in the corner played Patsy Cline at low volume. Black-and-white photographs in frames covered one entire wall. Coca-Cola ads from the Eisenhower era. Everything vintage, everything perfect, like the last thirty years hadn't happened.

A young woman sat in one of the booths, surrounded by notebooks and a camera. Late twenties, dark hair in a ponytail, wire-rimmed glasses. She looked up when he entered, offered a quick smile, went back to writing.

Behind the counter stood an elderly couple who looked like they'd been running diners since diners were invented.

The man was tall and bald with thick black-framed glasses and a prominent Adam's apple. He wore a spotless white shirt, black bow tie, and an apron that could've been bleached yesterday. His smile showed yellowed teeth.

"Welcome, friend!" Voice like a game show host. "Take a seat anywhere you like. We'll get you fixed up."

The woman was short and round with white hair permed into tight curls, rouge on her cheeks, cat-eye glasses on a chain. She wore a floral housedress and orthopedic stockings. Her hands were busy wiping down the already-clean counter.

"Iced tea?" she asked. "Coffee? You look like you walked a ways, hon."

"Couple miles," Victor admitted, sliding onto a stool. The vinyl was cool against his back. "My truck broke down east of here. Fuel pump, I think. You have a phone I could use?"

"Oh, the payphone outside works just fine." The old man—presumably Earl, according to the faded "Earl's Diner" painted on the window—was already pouring iced tea into a glass so cold it fogged immediately. "But I should tell you, nearest mechanic is Dale Porter. He'll be by around suppertime. Always stops for coffee."

"Suppertime?" Victor glanced at his watch. 3:47 PM. "That's a few hours."

"Time moves different out here," the old woman—Dotty, had to be—said cheerfully. She set the tea in front of him. "Drink up, sweetie. You'll feel better."

Victor did. The tea was perfect—sweet but not too sweet, cold enough to hurt his teeth. He drained half the glass.

The door jingled again.

A guy in his mid-twenties shuffled in, all coiled energy and hollow eyes. Shaggy blond hair, scruffy beard, army jacket with a 101st Airborne patch despite the heat. He carried a battered duffel bag and moved like he was expecting an ambush from any direction. His pale blue eyes scanned the diner—exits, occupants, threats—before he slid into a booth near the back.

Combat vet, Victor figured. Seen that look before at truck stops. The ones who came back but didn't quite make it all the way home.

"Coffee," the guy said. "Black."

"Coming right up, hon." Dotty was already moving, pot in hand, like she'd anticipated the order.

The woman with the notebooks looked up again. She met Victor's eyes briefly, glanced at the vet, then back to her work. But her pen had stopped moving.

Victor finished his tea. "This Dale Porter—he any good?"

"Best mechanic in three counties," Earl said, whistling some big-band tune while he wiped glasses that already gleamed. "Runs the garage next door. He'll get you sorted."

A tow truck rumbled into the parking lot outside, right on cue.

Victor watched through the window as a compact man in his mid-forties climbed out. Weathered brown skin, black hair going gray at the temples, snap-button Western shirt with a turquoise bolo tie. He moved with the economy of someone who never wasted motion.

When he entered, Earl called out: "Dale! Perfect timing. This fellow's got truck trouble a couple miles east."

Dale looked at Victor with deep-set eyes that seemed to measure and assess in one glance. "What kind of truck?"

"'78 Peterbilt. Fuel pump's shot."

"Part won't come in until tomorrow morning," Dale said. Not a question. Statement of fact. "Town's fifty miles back. Supplier closes at five."

Victor checked his watch again. Not enough time.

"You're stuck overnight," Dale continued. "I can tow your rig back here, work on it first thing. Have you rolling by noon tomorrow."

"Overnight." Victor looked around the diner. Back at Earl and Dotty, who smiled with identical too-wide expressions. At the young woman with her research. At the vet nursing his coffee like it was the only thing keeping him upright.

"We've got booths," Dotty offered. "Comfortable enough for sleeping. And Earl makes the best burgers west of Albuquerque. You'll be our guests. On the house."

"On the house?" Victor frowned. Nobody gave away food. Not in 1982, not ever.

"We don't get much traffic anymore," Earl explained, his smile never wavering. "Interstate took it all. We're just happy for the company."

The young woman closed her notebook. "I'm stuck too. I'm Grace Martinez, University of New Mexico. I'm documenting Route 66 businesses for my dissertation." She gestured to the diner's pristine interior. "This place is incredible. Like nothing's changed since 1955."

"Because nothing has," Dotty said proudly. "We keep things the way folks remember."

Something about the way she said it made the hair on Victor's neck stand up. He couldn't place why.

Through the window, the sun was already descending toward the western mesas. Shadows stretched long across the parking lot. Out here, darkness would come fast and absolute.

Dale ordered coffee. The vet—he still hadn't given his name—chain-smoked in his booth, watching everyone. Grace asked Earl and Dotty questions about the diner's history, her pen flying across the page.

And behind the counter, a waitress Victor hadn't noticed before emerged from the kitchen.

She was young, mid-twenties, with bottle-blonde hair in a 1950s-style ponytail. She wore a pink uniform with a white apron and carried herself like someone performing a role in a play they'd rehearsed ten thousand times. Her name tag read "Denise" in cheerful cursive.

When she poured more iced tea into Victor's glass, her hands shook so badly the pitcher rattled against the rim.

"You okay?" Victor asked quietly.

Her eyes met his for just a second—bright blue, very wide, very frightened.

"Everything's just peachy," she said in a bright voice that didn't match her expression at all. Then she was gone, back to the kitchen, moving like she was trying not to run.

Victor looked around the diner again. Really looked.

The preservation was too perfect. Not "well-maintained." Perfect. Like the place had been frozen in amber in 1955 and hermetically sealed. The vinyl on the booths should be cracked. The chrome should be pitted. The linoleum should be worn through in high-traffic areas. Instead, everything gleamed like it was brand new.

And Earl and Dotty moved in perfect synchronization—when Earl turned to the grill, Dotty turned to the coffee pot, like dancers who'd rehearsed the same routine for decades. When Earl whistled, Dotty hummed. They never touched, never spoke to each other, but they seemed to share thoughts.

Outside the windows, the sun dropped below the horizon.

Darkness fell like a curtain dropping on a stage.

And it was absolute. No ambient light from distant towns. No glow from Interstate traffic. No stars yet. Just the diner's neon "EAT" sign flickering to life, burning red in an ocean of black, visible for miles in every direction.

The only light in the entire world.

Victor felt his stomach drop. They were isolated. Genuinely, completely isolated.

The door jingled one more time. Denise approached their scattered group—Victor at the counter, Grace in her booth, the vet in his, Dale at a corner table—with menus.

"Dinner's on the house," she said in that same bright, frightened voice. "Earl's making burgers tonight. Best you'll ever have."

"We don't get much company anymore," Dotty added from behind the counter. "You're our guests. Please. Stay. Eat. Rest."

Too generous. Too welcoming. Too perfect.

And outside, the darkness pressed against the plate-glass windows like something alive.

Victor met Grace's eyes across the diner. Saw his own unease reflected back. The vet was watching the windows, hands tense. Dale stared at his coffee, jaw tight.

But there was nowhere to go. No vehicles that worked. Fifty miles of desert in every direction. Night cold could kill as easily as day heat.

They were trapped.

And Earl and Dotty smiled their too-wide smiles and moved in perfect synchronization and waited.
