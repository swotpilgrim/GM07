# Chapter 7: The Freezer

Victor had spent twelve years on the road. Every instinct he'd developed about diners was screaming about this one.

Mid-morning—the third day, maybe? Time felt wrong—he stood outside smoking one of Ricky's Camels. Through the window: Earl at the grill, Dotty wiping tables. Their synchronized dance, never stopping, never tiring.

The walk-in freezer was visible from this angle. Heavy steel door with a padlock.

Why lock a freezer?

He crushed the cigarette, walked to Dale's tow truck.

"Dale. Need your crowbar."

Dale slid out from under Victor's Peterbilt. "What for?"

"The freezer. It's locked."

Dale's jaw tightened. "You sure?"

"No."

Dale retrieved the crowbar—heavy iron, three feet long. "Want company?"

"Yeah."

Inside, Earl and Dotty were at the far end, backs turned. Victor moved quickly to the freezer, jammed the crowbar behind the hasp, threw his weight.

The metal shrieked. The hasp tore free.

"Sir, that's private—" Earl started toward him.

Victor yanked the door open.

Cold air billowed out. Frost vapor obscured his vision for a second.

Then he saw.

Bodies.

Dozens of them.

Human bodies frozen solid, arranged in rows like cordwood. Men, women, different ages, different clothing styles. All perfectly preserved by the cold, expressions frozen in various states of terror or confusion.

And carved into the ice above each body: names, dates.

"Robert Marsh - 1955"

"Susan Chen - 1967"

"David Kowalski - 1974"

Victor's stomach lurched. He staggered backward.

Dale looked inside, went gray. His lips moved silently—prayer in Laguna.

Grace pushed past, camera in hand. Her Pentax hit the floor.

Victor made it outside before he vomited. Fell to his knees in the gravel and heaved.

"Thirty-seven bodies," Grace's voice said, high and thin.

Ricky appeared, looked inside. His hollow-eyed vet demeanor vanished, replaced by combat soldier assessing a massacre.

"Crime scene," he said flatly. "Don't touch anything. We need law enforcement, FBI, and we need to secure the suspects."

"Suspects?" Grace's voice was shaking. "Earl and Dotty—"

"Are serial killers," Ricky finished. "Where are they?"

Victor wiped his mouth, forced himself upright. "They were here a second ago."

The diner was empty. Earl and Dotty had vanished.

"Doesn't matter." Ricky locked the door from inside. "We secure, document, leave."

"Phone's dead, vehicles sabotaged," Grace said.

"Then we walk." Ricky turned. "Denise!"

She stood in the kitchen doorway, tears streaming. "You knew," Victor said.

Denise's knees buckled. She collapsed, back against the wall, sobbing.

Grace moved to her, knelt. "Hey. Hey, it's okay—"

"It's not okay!" Denise's voice came out raw. "I've tried to warn people! I've tried to— thirty years, I've watched them kill thirty-seven people and I couldn't stop it, couldn't leave, couldn't—"

"Thirty years?" Victor interrupted. "You're what, twenty-five?"

"Twenty-four," Denise whispered. "I've been twenty-four since June 1952. Since I came here for a waitress job and watched them kill a drifter named Johnny who'd been nice to me, who'd told me about Hollywood and said I had a pretty smile, and I tried to run but I woke up back in my bed here and I tried again and again and I can't leave, I can never leave—"

She dissolved into sobs. Grace held her, looked helplessly at Victor.

Dale had returned to the freezer, examining it with a mechanic's eye. "Labels are carved into ice. Dates go back to 1955. Most recent is... three weeks ago."

Three weeks. Victor's stomach lurched again but he controlled it. "We need to document everything. Then we leave. All of us."

"Denise," Ricky said quietly. He crouched beside her. His voice was gentler than Victor had heard before. "I know this is hard. But we need information. Where are Earl and Dotty now?"

"I don't know," she whispered. "They know you know now. They'll come back. They always come back."

"Their patterns," Ricky pressed. "How do they kill people?"

Denise shuddered. "Drug the food first. Mild sedative in coffee or pie. Wait until the person's alone and drowsy. Then Earl uses his meat hook—quick, to the spine. Or Dotty uses knives. They're fast. Very fast. Then they freeze the body, bury it in the desert at night, and photograph something the person owned for the wall."

The photo wall. Victor felt pieces clicking together. All those framed pictures—vehicles, jackets, personal items. Trophy gallery.

"How many people have passed through without them killing?" Victor asked.

"Lots. They're selective. They choose people who won't be missed. Drifters, runaways, truckers on unusual routes. People with no itinerary, no one expecting them." Denise wiped her face. "That's why they kept me. I called my mother the first week, told her I was staying longer. Then Earl killed the next traveler and I understood. Anyone who knows someone's here is safer. Anyone expected somewhere is safer."

"Our university knows I'm on Route 66," Grace said. "My advisor—"

"Knows generally, not specifically," Denise said. "And you—" looking at Victor, "—your dispatch knows you're delayed, not where exactly. And him—" indicating Ricky, "—nobody knows where he is at all."

Ricky's expression didn't change but Victor saw him tense.

"Dale?" Grace asked.

"I'm local. People know I'm here." Dale straightened from the freezer. "Might be why I'm still breathing."

"Or they're waiting," Ricky said. "Processing us. Deciding who's safe to kill."

The implications hung in the air.

Victor looked at the walk-in freezer, its door hanging open, cold vapor still billowing out. Thirty-seven bodies. Thirty-seven people who'd stopped at a chrome diner on a forgotten highway and never left.

People like him.

"We need weapons," he said. "And we need to move fast."

Grace had retrieved her camera, was photographing the freezer's interior. Her hands shook but her documentation was methodical—wide shots, close-ups of labels, individual victims. Building evidence.

"Grace," Victor said gently. "We don't have time for a full catalog."

"Evidence," she insisted. "If we get out of here, if we can get authorities, we need proof. Otherwise it's just our word against—against whatever Earl and Dotty are."

She was right. Victor helped Dale examine the freezer more carefully. The dates carved in ice ranged from 1955 to three weeks ago. Thirty-seven victims, just as Grace had counted. Men and women, various ages. Some in period clothing from decades past—a woman in a 1960s dress, a man in a 1970s leisure suit.

All preserved perfectly by the cold. Like they'd died yesterday.

Ricky was searching the kitchen, opening drawers and cabinets. He assembled a collection on the counter: chef's knives, a meat cleaver, a hammer, the crowbar.

"Weapons," he said. "Everyone takes something. Don't leave it behind, don't put it down. We're armed from now until we're out of here."

Victor took the hammer, felt its weight. He'd never hit a person in his life. But looking at the freezer, at the trophy wall, at Denise's thirty years of terror—

He could learn.

"Where are Earl and Dotty?" Grace asked again, looking around nervously.

"Somewhere in the building," Denise said. She'd stopped crying, was pulling herself together with visible effort. "Or outside. They never go far from the diner. This place is their territory."

Their territory. The phrasing made Victor think of predators marking hunting grounds.

"Denise," he said carefully. "You said you've tried to leave hundreds of times. What happens?"

"I just... wake up back here. Drive away, wake up in my bed. Walk into the desert, wake up in my bed. One time I made it all the way to a police station in Carlsbad and told them everything." Her voice went flat. "Woke up in my bed. Like it never happened. Like I never left."

"Supernatural imprisonment," Dale said quietly. "Bound to the place. My grandfather's stories mentioned it—thin places claim certain people, keep them as part of the loop."

Victor wanted to reject that. Wanted to insist on rational explanations. But he was standing ten feet from a freezer full of murdered travelers, in a diner run by people who'd died in 1955, having watched phantom customers appear with no vehicles.

Rational was out the window.

"Okay," he said. Forcing his voice steady, forcing himself to think tactically. "We assume we can't call for help. We assume our vehicles are compromised. We arm ourselves, we stay together, and we walk out of here. Fifty miles to the nearest town. We can make that in two days if we carry water."

"Desert heat," Dale warned. "August in New Mexico. We'd need a lot of water. And supplies."

"We take everything from the diner. Food, water, supplies. Load up and move."

Ricky nodded. "Dawn departure. Walk during early morning before heat peaks, rest during mid-day, walk evening. Possible."

It was a plan. Maybe not a good one, but better than staying in a diner full of bodies with two killers somewhere nearby.

"Tonight we barricade ourselves in here," Victor continued. "Secure the doors, stay armed, stay awake. Tomorrow at first light, we move."

Grace lowered her camera. Dale gripped his wrench. Ricky checked the knives' edges. Denise hugged herself, hope and terror warring in her expression.

And somewhere in the diner—or outside in the desert, or perhaps in whatever liminal space thin places accessed—Earl and Dotty waited.

The freezer hummed quietly. The bodies rested in their frozen sleep.

Thirty-seven victims.

Victor looked at each of his companions, silently promising: we won't be thirty-eight through forty-one.

They'd get out.

Or die trying.
