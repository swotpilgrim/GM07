# Chapter 2: Comfort Food

Grace Martinez had photographed seventeen dying Route 66 businesses in the past month. Most were abandoned shells with caved roofs and graffiti. Two were converted to storage. One was a meth house the local sheriff politely but firmly escorted her away from.

None of them looked like this.

The Desert Diner was pristine. More than that—it was perfect. The kind of perfect that didn't exist in real life, only in carefully curated museum exhibits or nostalgic movies about an America that never actually was.

She adjusted her Pentax and framed another shot: the Wurlitzer jukebox glowing soft amber, Patsy Cline crackling from its speakers, chrome edges catching the overhead lights. Through the viewfinder, it looked like a photograph from 1955. She lowered the camera, checked the reality. It still looked like 1955.

Her dissertation advisor would kill for this documentation.

"You're a photographer, hon?" Dotty appeared at Grace's booth with a fresh pot of coffee, filling the cup without asking. The coffee smelled incredible—rich and dark, nothing like the dishwater most diners served.

"Doctoral candidate," Grace said, setting her camera aside. "American Studies at UNM. My dissertation's on Route 66 as a cultural artifact—how the Interstate system's displacement created nostalgic mythology around a highway that was always more idea than reality."

"Well, aren't you smart." Dotty's smile was wide and genuine. "Earl! This young lady's writing about us for a book."

"Dissertation," Grace corrected, but Dotty was already moving away.

Earl appeared from the kitchen, wiping his hands on his apron. Up close, Grace noticed details: his bow tie was perfectly straight, his glasses spotlessly clean, his movements economical and practiced. "A book about Route 66? Well, you've come to the right place. We've been here since 1948."

"Really?" Grace pulled out her notebook, pen poised. "Could I interview you? For the research?"

"Be our pleasure." Earl gestured to the counter. "But let me make you folks dinner first. Can't talk on an empty stomach."

Grace glanced around the diner. The trucker—Victor, she'd heard Earl call him—sat at the counter nursing iced tea and looking deeply unhappy about his situation. The mechanic, Dale, occupied a corner booth with coffee, quiet and watchful. And the veteran in the army jacket chain-smoked near the back, his pale eyes tracking every movement in the room.

Five strangers trapped overnight in a diner in the middle of nowhere. It would be funny if it wasn't so unsettling.

Earl moved behind the counter to the grill. Dotty fell into step beside him without discussion, no communication Grace could see. Earl pulled burger patties from the cooler—hand-formed, generous size. Dotty sliced tomatoes and onions. Earl placed patties on the griddle with a sizzle. Dotty toasted buns. Earl flipped burgers with a spatula. Dotty arranged plates.

They moved like dancers performing a routine they'd done ten thousand times. No wasted motion. No verbal cues. Perfect synchronization.

Grace's anthropology training kicked in. She'd studied ritual behavior, how repeated actions became ingrained, how long-married couples developed nonverbal communication. But this was something else. They didn't look at each other, didn't acknowledge each other's presence, yet they never collided, never reached for the same thing, never missed a beat.

It was beautiful and deeply weird.

"You folks want cheese?" Earl called out, still not looking away from the grill. But somehow he was addressing all of them simultaneously.

"Please," Victor said.

"No cheese for me," Grace added.

The vet—he still hadn't given his name—didn't respond. Dotty poured him more coffee anyway, placed a plate in front of him with a burger, fries, pickle. He stared at it like it might be poisoned.

Dale just nodded when Dotty looked his way.

Within ten minutes, they all had food.

Grace lifted the burger, took a bite, and stopped.

It was perfect. Not good. Perfect. The beef tasted like it came from cattle that grazed on heaven's grass. The bun was soft but structurally sound. The ratio of condiments to meat was ideal. The fries were crispy outside, fluffy inside, salted just right.

"Jesus," Victor muttered. "This is..."

"Best burger west of Albuquerque," Earl said proudly, whistling some big-band tune Grace couldn't quite place. "We use beef from a ranch thirty miles south. Guy raises them right."

Grace ate methodically, watching Earl and Dotty move through the diner's space. Earl cooked. Dotty served. Earl wiped down the grill. Dotty refilled drinks. They orbited each other in perfect circles, never touching, never speaking, utterly in sync.

When Denise emerged from the kitchen carrying ketchup bottles, the rhythm broke.

Just for a second. Earl turned toward the counter at the same moment Denise passed behind it. They nearly collided. Earl's hand shot out, steadying her by the shoulder.

Denise flinched like she'd been struck.

"Careful there, sweetie," Earl said, his too-wide smile never faltering. His hand lingered a moment longer than necessary before releasing her.

"Sorry," Denise whispered. Her face had gone pale. She clutched the ketchup bottles tight enough that her knuckles went white.

Earl returned to the grill, whistling. Denise stood frozen for three full seconds before continuing her rounds.

Grace met her eyes as she passed. Up close, the waitress looked younger than Grace initially thought—maybe mid-twenties, though styled like someone from a different era entirely. Victory rolls, cat-eye liner, that pink uniform with white apron. The whole aesthetic was aggressively 1950s.

"Everything okay?" Grace asked quietly.

"Peachy." Denise's smile was bright and utterly unconvincing. "You folks need anything, just holler."

She was gone before Grace could respond.

The vet had noticed too. His pale eyes tracked Denise's retreat, then shifted to Earl, assessing. His hand tapped a rhythm on the table—not nervous, deliberate. Like he was counting threats.

Victor was focused on his burger, but his shoulders were tense. Dale stared into his coffee with an expression Grace couldn't read.

"So," Grace said, pulling out her notebook again, trying to break the strange tension. "1948? You've been running this diner thirty-four years?"

"That's right." Dotty slid into the booth across from her, settling in like they were old friends. Earl remained at the grill but turned slightly, listening. "Earl came back from the war, and we bought this land for almost nothing. Built the diner with our own hands."

"World War II?" Grace scribbled notes.

"Korea," Earl corrected. "Got back in '52, married Dotty, opened this place in '48."

Grace's pen stopped. The math didn't work. She looked up.

Earl was still whistling, focused on cleaning the grill. Dotty's expression hadn't changed—pleasant, open, friendly.

"You opened in '48 but Earl was in Korea until '52?" Grace asked carefully.

"Did I say '48?" Dotty laughed. "Meant '53. Getting old, you know. Dates run together."

But Grace had heard her clearly. 1948. She'd said it twice.

She let it go, kept asking questions. Route 66's glory days in the fifties and sixties, the slow decline in the seventies, the death blow when Interstate 40 opened parallel to this section in 1975. How they'd survived when every other business closed.

"We get by," Earl said. "Don't need much. Travelers still come through sometimes. And we've always been patient people."

"Lots of folks used to stop here," Dotty added, her eyes distant. "Families heading west. Young people looking for fresh starts. Folks running from something or running toward something. Everyone passes through Route 66 eventually."

"Used to," Earl agreed. "Not so much anymore. These days it's mostly the lost ones."

"Lost ones?" Grace asked.

"People looking for the America they remember," Dotty said. "Or think they remember. The one from before." She gestured vaguely. "Before everything got complicated."

The way she said it raised goosebumps on Grace's arms. Outside the plate-glass windows, full darkness had fallen. The desert was completely invisible. No moonlight, no starlight yet. Just the red neon "EAT" sign reflecting off the glass, turning the windows into dark mirrors.

Grace caught her own reflection. Behind her, Earl and Dotty moved through the diner. In the reflection, they looked like ghosts—pale shapes gliding without sound.

She turned to look directly at them. Solid, real, elderly couple cleaning up after dinner service.

Turned back to the window. Ghost shapes moving in perfect synchronization.

"You folks must be tired," Dotty announced. "The booths are comfortable for sleeping. We've got blankets. And we're open all night, so if you need anything, just ask."

"All night?" Victor asked. "You don't close?"

"Hasn't been a reason to close in years," Earl said. "Someone might need us."

The vet—Grace was starting to think of him as Combat Vet since he refused to introduce himself—stubbed out his cigarette and immediately lit another. "You get much traffic at 3 AM?"

"You'd be surprised," Dotty said. "People drive at strange hours out here. Trying to beat the heat. Or running from something. There's always someone."

Grace tried to keep her expression neutral, journalistic. But nothing about this conversation felt right. The Dotty's eyes were too bright, too fixed. Earl's whistle never varied in pitch or tempo. And the synchronized movement continued—Dotty collecting plates exactly when Earl turned to rinse his spatula, their orbits mathematically precise.

"I'll take first watch," Combat Vet said suddenly. He wasn't looking at anyone in particular, just stating fact. "You folks sleep. I'll stay up."

Victor nodded slowly. "Yeah. Okay. Good idea."

Dale said nothing, but his jaw was tight.

Grace understood without anything being said explicitly: none of them wanted to sleep with their backs to Earl and Dotty. None of them trusted the too-perfect hospitality, the too-generous offers, the too-synchronized movements.

None of them felt safe.

"Well, you're all welcome to stay up as long as you like," Dotty said cheerfully. "We'll be right here if you need anything."

"Right here," Earl echoed, whistling.

Grace gathered her camera and notebooks, slid into a booth where she could see the whole diner. Victor took a stool at the counter, angled so his back wasn't to the room. Dale remained in his corner. Combat Vet positioned himself near the door.

Outside, in the absolute darkness, the neon "EAT" sign pulsed red. On. Off. On. Off.

Like a heartbeat.

Grace opened her notebook, tried to write observations. But her pen hovered over the page. She kept watching Earl and Dotty move through their routines—wiping already-clean surfaces, organizing already-organized supplies, moving in their perfect synchronization.

They'd been doing this since 1948.

Or 1953.

Or maybe longer.

The diner was warm, the food had been perfect, the hospitality overwhelming.

And Grace had never felt more trapped in her life.
