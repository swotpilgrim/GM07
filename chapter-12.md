# Chapter 12: Patterns and Victims

Grace spread photographs across the hood of her van like a coroner laying out evidence.

Thirty-seven faces stared back. Some from Polaroids on the diner wall, some from her Pentax documentation of the freezer. Young and old, men and women, spanning three decades. Each one a person who'd stopped at a chrome diner on a forgotten highway and never left.

Denise sat beside her, naming them.

"Robert Marsh, 1955. First one I saw them kill. Hitchhiker, heading to California. Said he was estranged from his family back east." Her finger moved to the next photo. "Susan Chen, 1956. Runaway, seventeen, fleeing arranged marriage. Told Earl and Dotty she was going somewhere no one would find her."

Grace documented each name, each date, building a database of the disappeared.

The pattern emerged quickly.

"They're all transients," Victor observed, looking over Grace's shoulder. "No roots, no destinations, no one expecting them."

"Not entirely," Grace said. She'd been cross-referencing Denise's memories with the photos. "Look—1962, this trucker. Denise, what was his story?"

"James Kowalski. Had a wife in Tulsa, regular route. But he'd deviated—told Earl he was meeting someone secret, someone his wife couldn't know about. Affair, probably."

"So not transient, but transgressive. Off his normal pattern, hiding something."

Ricky leaned against the van, smoking. "Deviants. People who won't be immediately missed because they're where they shouldn't be."

"Exactly," Grace said. Writing notes rapidly. "The victim profile isn't just about being alone. It's about being unaccounted for. People who have reasons not to check in, not to be tracked."

She arranged the photos chronologically, looking for patterns in timing.

"1955 through 1965—one or two victims per year. Conservative pace."

"Route 66 was busy then," Dale said. "Lots of traffic, lots of travelers passing through. Earl and Dotty could be selective."

"Then 1966 through 1975—three to five per year. Increase."

"Interstate 40 opened in sections during that period," Dale added. "Traffic on Route 66 declined. Fewer travelers meant they had to kill more frequently to maintain... whatever they're maintaining."

"The thin place?" Grace suggested. "Maybe it needs death to sustain itself. Fewer natural traffic means more deliberate hunting."

Denise shook her head. "I don't think the place requires death. I think Earl and Dotty do. They're predators. The diner just gives them hunting ground and camouflage."

Grace considered that. Two theories: supernatural place demanding sacrifice, or dead killers acting on ingrained predation. Maybe both were true—parasites in symbiosis with their environment.

"1976 to present—the rate drops again. One to two per year, like the early period. But Route 66 is nearly abandoned by then. Why the decrease?"

"They're starving," Denise said quietly. "Traffic is so sparse now that travelers passing through are rare. They can't risk killing the few who stop—word would spread, authorities would investigate. Better to let ninety percent pass safely, kill the ten percent who fit perfect criteria."

"We don't fit perfect criteria," Victor pointed out. "Grace's university knows her route. My dispatch knows I'm delayed. Dale is local. Only Ricky is truly off-grid."

Ricky shrugged. "Most vets are."

"But they sabotaged all our vehicles," Grace said. "They're processing us. Which means either criteria changed, or we triggered something."

"The freezer," Denise said. "Once you discovered that, you became threats. Can't let threats leave."

Grace studied the victim photos more carefully. Ages ranging from teenagers to seventies. Various races, though predominantly white—reflected Route 66 demographics. Economic status appeared mostly working class. Several in military clothing, a few in business suits, most in casual travel wear.

"What about method?" she asked Denise. "You said meat hook and knives. Every victim?"

"Earl's meat hook is primary—spine strike, fast immobilization. Dotty finishes with knives. Always the same. They're efficient."

"No experimentation? No variation?"

"None. It's routine. Like cooking the same burger recipe every day."

Grace made notes. Serial killers often evolved methods, escalated. But Earl and Dotty were frozen in 1955 methodology, repeating the same kill pattern across decades. More evidence they were operating automatically, consciousness degrading into pure function.

She photographed the victim wall again, this time noting what trophies corresponded to which bodies.

"Each victim has an item photographed," she said. "Vehicle, clothing, personal effect. Why?"

"Memory," Dale suggested. "Or claiming. Hunters mount trophies to remember kills."

"But they're not conscious hunters anymore," Grace argued. "They're automatons. So maybe the thin place requires trophies. Physical anchors to keep victims bound."

She looked at the photos with that theory in mind. A 1967 Mustang photographed in the parking lot—owner frozen in the walk-in. A leather jacket on a hook—drifter buried in the desert. Wedding ring on a finger—victim whose spouse would never know what happened.

Each trophy told a story. Grace examined them systematically:

The Mustang belonged to Peter Williams, age 23, UCLA student who'd told Earl he was driving to Mexico to "disappear for a while." The jacket: Sarah Mendez, runaway from Texas, fourteen years old. The ring: Thomas Chen, businessman having an affair, told Dotty he was "taking a different route home."

Every victim had been vulnerable in some way. Not just physically isolated—emotionally isolated. People running from something or toward something secret. People who'd severed their own safety nets before Earl and Dotty severed their lives.

"These are anchors," Grace said, certainty building. "The place keeps the victims through their belongings. That's why phantom customers appear—they're bound to the diner through the trophies on display."

"Can we destroy them?" Ricky asked. "Break the anchors, free the victims?"

"Maybe. Or maybe that makes things worse—unleashes whatever's bound."

Victor was examining the victim timeline Grace had constructed. "What's the longest gap between kills?"

Denise thought. "1973. Six months with no murders. Earl tried to quit—refused to kill. I watched him age rapidly, skin graying, eyes yellowing. Dotty aged too. They were dying again, for real. Then a hitchhiker stopped in November, and Earl... couldn't resist. Killed him, and they snapped back to normal. Young, energetic, themselves again."

"So they need to kill," Grace said. "Not the place—them specifically. It sustains them."

"Makes them vampires, essentially," Ricky said. "Undead predators feeding to maintain existence."

"Metaphorically," Dale corrected. "But yes. They died in 1955, came back, and discovered they need death to stay back. So they provide it."

Grace assembled her documentation: photos of victims, timeline of kills, pattern analysis, trophy identification, methodology notes. Academic rigor applied to impossible horror.

She cross-referenced victim locations against missing persons databases she'd memorized from research. Several names matched unsolved cases:

Robert Marsh—missing from Arkansas, 1955. Family never stopped searching.
Susan Chen—San Francisco runaway, assumed dead.
James Kowalski—Tulsa trucker, presumed to have abandoned his family.
Peter Williams—UCLA student, case went cold after Mexico border reports.
Sarah Mendez—Texas runaway, fourteen years old, never found.

Each one a family's nightmare. Each one solvable now, if Grace could get this evidence out.

"If we get out of here," she said, "this goes to authorities. FBI, state police, everyone. Thirty-seven murders, documented, mapped, explained. Families get answers."

"Will anyone believe it?" Victor asked.

"The bodies are real. The evidence is real. DNA can identify remains, match to missing persons. Belief becomes secondary to prosecution."

She looked at the photos again. Thirty-seven faces. Thirty-seven people whose families might still wonder, might still hope. Decades of missing persons cases that could be solved, closure provided, graves properly marked.

This documentation mattered. It was justice, or the closest thing to justice the dead would ever receive.

"We need to photograph the burial site more thoroughly," Grace said. "Dale's ground-penetrating scans showed thirty-seven anomalies. If we can map exact locations, cross-reference with victim identities, that gives authorities everything they need for excavation and identification."

"Forensic teams will need detailed maps," Victor agreed. "GPS coordinates, depth measurements, spatial relationships."

"I can provide that," Dale said. "My equipment is precise. Used it for utility line mapping—works for graves too."

Grace made notes. Evidence chain was crucial. Everything needed to be documented properly or it became inadmissible. Photos, measurements, witness testimony, physical remains. Build a case that could survive legal scrutiny.

"Tomorrow," Victor said. "Tonight we survive. Tomorrow we document further, then we plan escape."

Grace gathered the photos carefully, filed them in her camera bag. Each victim's face memorized, each name recorded. She was the keeper of their stories now. Responsible for making sure they weren't forgotten.

"Denise," she said quietly. "Thank you. For remembering them. For thirty years, you've been the only person who knew their names, who saw them as people instead of numbers. That matters."

Denise's eyes filled. "I couldn't save them."

"But you witnessed them. Kept their memory alive. That's not nothing."

They sat in silence as desert night deepened. Somewhere in the darkness, thirty-seven bodies lay buried in neat rows. Somewhere in the thin place's twisted geography, thirty-seven phantoms drifted through endless loops. And somewhere inside the diner, Earl and Dotty Higgins moved through their eternal choreography, dead twenty-seven years, serving forever.

Grace looked at her companions. Five living people caught in a trap designed for the dead.

But they had documentation. They had knowledge. They had each other.

And tomorrow, they'd fight back.
