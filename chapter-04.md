# Chapter 4: Night Shift

Ricky Kovacs hadn't slept properly in five years.

Vietnam taught him that closing your eyes meant dying. Two tours, heavy combat, the kind that rewired your brain at the molecular level. He'd tried sleeping after—doctors prescribed pills, therapists suggested techniques, his mother begged him to just rest.

Couldn't do it. Every time he started to drift, his body jolted him awake. Survival reflex. Sleep equals death.

So he sat in his booth at the back of the diner, smoking Camels and watching.

The others had tried sleeping. Victor sat slumped at the counter, arms crossed, head down. Grace curled in her booth with camera as pillow, notebook clutched to her chest like a talisman. Dale had stretched out in a corner booth, cowboy hat over his face.

But Ricky could tell none of them were really sleeping. Their breathing was wrong—too shallow, too quick. They were all hypervigilant now, whether they admitted it or not.

The diner felt different at night.

During the day—if you could call late afternoon "day"—it had been surreal but still tethered to reality. Now, as the hours bled past midnight, it felt like they'd crossed into somewhere else. A pocket dimension wearing a diner's skin.

Earl and Dotty never stopped working.

Never paused, never sat, never showed fatigue. They moved through their routines with mechanical precision—wiping surfaces already clean, organizing supplies already organized, preparing food no one ordered. The synchronized choreography continued without variation.

Ricky tracked them with his peripheral vision while watching the windows. Old jungle trick: don't stare directly, watch for movement at the edges. The darkness outside was absolute—no stars yet, no moon, just the red neon "EAT" sign reflecting off the glass.

His watch read 11:47 PM when the first customer arrived.

The bells jingled.

Ricky's hand went to his belt—instinct, no weapon there anymore, civilian now. He watched as a woman entered the diner.

She was maybe sixty, wearing clothes from the 1960s—a pillbox hat, white gloves, a dress with a geometric pattern. She moved with a strange, floating quality, not quite walking normally.

"Coffee, please," she said to Dotty. Her voice sounded distant, like it was coming from the bottom of a well.

Dotty poured without reaction. Like a customer arriving at midnight dressed in thirty-year-old fashion was completely normal.

The woman sat at the counter three stools from where Victor dozed. She didn't look at him. Didn't look at anything. Just stared ahead with vacant eyes while drinking coffee in small, mechanical sips.

Ricky glanced at the parking lot through the window.

No car. No vehicle at all besides the ones that had been there before.

He stubbed out his cigarette, immediately lit another.

The woman finished her coffee, left exact change, stood. Walked to the door. The bells jingled. She vanished into darkness.

Ricky waited for his eyes to adjust to the desert night, to see her walking away. The neon glow extended maybe twenty feet into the parking lot before being swallowed by black.

She didn't walk away.

She just... wasn't there anymore.

"You saw her?" Grace's whisper came from her booth. Not sleeping after all.

"Yeah."

"No car."

"No car."

They sat in shared silence. Earl and Dotty continued their choreography. The jukebox played Patsy Cline on loop—"Crazy" transitioning to "Walking After Midnight" and back again.

At 12:33 AM, another customer arrived.

Young man this time, maybe early twenties. Hollow eyes, sunken cheeks, wearing a leather jacket and jeans. He ordered pie, ate it in slow motion, left money, departed. No vehicle. Appeared from darkness, returned to darkness.

1:15 AM: an elderly trucker with a face like weathered leather. Ordered coffee and eggs. Earl cooked at 1 AM without questioning it. The trucker ate, paid, left. No rig in the parking lot. No sound of an engine starting.

"This is wrong," Victor muttered. He'd given up pretending to sleep, was watching with increasing tension.

"Very wrong," Grace agreed. She had her camera out, trying to photograph the customers. But every time she raised it, they'd turn away at the last second, or the flash wouldn't fire, or they'd be gone before the shutter clicked.

Ricky saw it differently.

This was combat. Different terrain, different enemy, but the same underlying truth: he was in hostile territory, surrounded by threats, and the rules of normal engagement didn't apply.

He moved to the counter when the next customer arrived—woman in her forties, 1970s bellbottoms and halter top, eyes distant and glassy.

"Excuse me," Ricky said to her. Direct approach. "Where's your car?"

She looked through him. Not at him—through him. Like he wasn't there.

"Ma'am, I asked you a question."

She turned to Earl. "Burger, please."

Earl smiled his too-wide smile. "Coming right up, hon."

The woman didn't acknowledge Ricky's existence. He was standing two feet away and she couldn't see him.

Denise appeared with coffee, saw Ricky's expression. Her eyes widened fractionally. She moved close while pouring, whispered so quietly he almost missed it:

"Don't talk to them."

"Who are they?"

"Nobody. They're nobody. Forget them by morning."

She moved away before he could press further.

The woman ate her burger in mechanical bites. Left money. Departed into darkness. Gone.

2:08 AM: a man in a business suit from the 1950s.

2:41 AM: a teenage boy in a letterman jacket.

2:52 AM: a couple holding hands, both translucent-pale.

They came in irregular intervals, ordered food, ate without tasting, paid exact change, departed into the black. None of them spoke beyond placing orders. None seemed aware of Ricky or the others. And none arrived in vehicles.

Grace was scribbling frantic notes. Victor had moved to a position where he could see all the doors. Dale sat upright, watching with an expression of deep resignation.

And Earl and Dotty served each phantom customer with the same cheerful efficiency they'd shown the real ones.

"We need to leave," Victor said quietly. "Soon as it's light, we get out of here. Walk if we have to."

"Fifty miles," Dale reminded him. "Desert heat. We'd die."

"Better than staying here."

Ricky wasn't sure about that. He'd seen people die in jungle heat, watched dehydration turn men into husks. But he'd also seen things in the war that Army psychiatrists insisted couldn't be real. Ghost villages that vanished by daylight. Enemy soldiers who disappeared mid-firefight. The line between real and unreal was thinner than people wanted to believe.

This diner existed on that line.

At 3:00 AM exactly, Denise dropped a plate.

The crash was obscenely loud in the diner's strange quiet. The plate shattered on the checkerboard floor, white ceramic exploding into pieces.

Denise stood frozen, staring at the shards. Her chest heaved. Her hands trembled.

Then she started crying.

Not sobbing—worse. Silent tears streaming down her face while her expression remained locked in that bright, cheerful smile. Her body shook. Tears dripped onto her pink uniform.

But she didn't make a sound.

Earl appeared with a broom. "Accidents happen, sweetie. Don't you worry."

He swept up the pieces with mechanical efficiency. Denise stood there crying silently. Earl dumped the shards in the trash, put the broom away, returned to the grill.

Never asked if she was okay. Never paused in his routine.

Dotty wiped down a table, humming.

Denise walked to the kitchen on shaking legs, still crying, still smiling.

Ricky watched her go. Recognized that particular brand of broken. He'd seen it in mirrors often enough.

At 3:47 AM, the phantom customers stopped coming.

The diner fell into an oppressive silence. Even the jukebox went quiet. Earl and Dotty continued their choreography, but without sound—wiping, organizing, moving in perfect synchronization through absolute quiet.

Ricky chain-smoked and watched the darkness press against the windows. His combat instincts screamed at him. Ambush coming. Danger imminent. Get out get out get out.

But there was nowhere to go. The desert night would kill them as surely as whatever was wrong with this place.

Grace had her notebook open, writing rapidly. Victor sat with his back to the wall, jaw tight. Dale stared at his coffee like it held answers.

"This isn't real," Victor said finally. "This can't be real."

"It's real," Ricky told him. Flat certainty. "Just not normal. There's a difference."

"What did you see in Vietnam?" Grace asked quietly.

Ricky lit another cigarette. "Enough to know reality has holes in it. Places where the rules don't work right. This diner's one of them."

"Thin places," Dale said softly. "My grandfather called them that. Spots where the boundary between worlds wears through."

Victor looked like he wanted to argue. But he'd seen the phantom customers too. The old man who'd vanished from Denise's memory. Earl and Dotty's impossible aging.

Evidence was piling up against rationality.

Outside the windows, the first hint of pre-dawn gray appeared at the horizon's edge. The darkness was receding, millimeter by millimeter.

Ricky felt his shoulders drop fractionally. He'd survived another night. Old habit from the war—take survival in increments. Make it to dawn. Make it to morning. Make it one more day.

Earl started cooking breakfast as if it was a normal morning.

The smell of coffee and bacon should have been comforting. Should have signaled safety, routine, normalcy.

Instead, it made Ricky's skin crawl.

Because Earl and Dotty had worked all night without stopping. Sixteen hours of constant motion. No bathroom breaks, no water, no rest. Moving with mechanical precision that wasn't human anymore.

If it ever had been.

Denise emerged from the kitchen with fresh makeup covering her tear-streaked face, smile bright and terrified, ready for the morning shift.

And somewhere in the desert behind the diner, Ricky was certain, there were things buried that would explain everything.

He just wasn't sure he wanted to know the explanation.

Dawn broke over the mesas. Gold light spilled across the scrubland. The diner looked different in daylight—more solid, more real.

But Ricky knew better.

Night would come again. The phantom customers would return. And whatever Earl and Dotty were, whatever this place was, it would still be here.

Waiting.

Always waiting.

He ground out his cigarette and immediately lit another, hands steady despite exhaustion.

Combat taught you lots of things. How to function without sleep. How to recognize when you were trapped. How to calculate your chances of survival.

Ricky ran the numbers.

They weren't good.
