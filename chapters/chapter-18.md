# Chapter 18: Earl and Dotty's Routine

Denise had watched the routine thirty-seven times. She could close her eyes and see each step with perfect clarity, a nightmare choreography burned into memory by repetition and helplessness. Now, sitting with the group in the diner's corner booth, she had to put it into words. Had to make them understand what was coming.

"They have a system," she began. Her hands twisted the towel in her lap, the same one she'd carried all night. Nearby, Earl hummed while wiping down the counter. Dotty refilled the coffee pot, her movements precise and mechanical. "Eight steps. They never vary."

Grace had her notebook open. Victor leaned forward, jaw tight. Ricky smoked, eyes tracking Earl's movements. Dale listened with the stillness of someone who'd heard similar stories and knew their weight.

"Step one," Denise said quietly. "Identify the victim. They're particular. Has to be someone alone, transient, without a fixed itinerary. Hitchhikers. Truckers on unusual routes. Drifters. Runaways. People who won't be immediately missed." She glanced at Victor. "You fit the profile. Your regular route is Denver-Phoenix on I-25. This detour on old Route 66—that made you a candidate."

Victor's expression darkened but he nodded for her to continue.

"Step two: establish comfort. First day or two, sometimes just hours. Earl and Dotty are friendly, welcoming. Good coffee, great food, sympathetic ear. They make you feel safe. Like a normal diner with normal owners. Practiced." Denise remembered Annie Chen laughing at one of Earl's jokes, how comfortable she'd looked right up until the moment she wasn't breathing anymore.

"Step three." Her voice dropped. "Drug the coffee or food. Nothing dramatic—just enough to make you drowsy, slow your reflexes, cloud your judgment. Mild sedative. You don't notice right away. Maybe you think it's road exhaustion, or the desert heat, or just needing sleep. But it's intentional."

Grace stopped writing. "What kind of sedative?"

"I don't know exactly. Earl keeps it in the kitchen, locked cabinet near the stove. Powder form. Dissolves in hot coffee without taste or color." Denise had watched him add it countless times, three measured teaspoons into a full pot. Scientific precision. "It works fast. Within an hour, you're feeling the effects."

Ricky straightened. "How long does it last?"

"Three, four hours. Long enough for step four: waiting until victim is alone and vulnerable. They're patient. Earl and Dotty can wait all day if needed, maintaining the friendly facade while the drug works through your system. They watch for the moment when you're isolated—bathroom trip, stepping outside for air, going to your vehicle. That's when they strike."

The diner felt too warm suddenly despite the air conditioning. Denise could see the kitchen from here, see Earl moving through it with the confidence of complete ownership. How many times had she watched him move from cheerful cook to efficient killer without any visible transition?

"Step five," she continued, forcing the words out. "The kill itself. Earl uses a meat hook—keeps it sharp, stores it in the freezer so it's always cold. Targets the spine at the base of the skull. Quick, quiet. Victim usually doesn't have time to scream. If they do, the desert swallows it." She swallowed hard. "Dotty prefers a knife. Throat cut, severing the carotid. Also fast. They're not cruel about it. No torture, no drawn-out suffering. Almost professional."

"Almost merciful," Ricky said, voice dripping sarcasm.

"I'm not defending them," Denise said sharply. "I'm telling you what they do. How they do it. If you're going to survive, you need to know."

Victor rubbed his face. "What happens after?"

"Step six: freezing. They move the body to the walk-in immediately. The cold preserves everything perfectly—no decay, no smell. Bodies can stay there for weeks if needed. They wait for the right time to bury."

"Which is when?" Grace asked.

"New moon. No moonlight means complete darkness. They dig at night—Earl mostly, Dotty keeps watch. Three-foot graves behind the diner, neat rows. Step seven: burial. Fast, efficient. They've done it so many times they can dig and fill a grave in under two hours." Denise closed her eyes briefly. "I've watched from the window. Forty-three times total. Thirty-seven of them stayed buried. Six were... moved later. I don't know where."

Dale stirred. "Moved why?"

"I don't know. Maybe buried wrong, maybe the ground was wrong. They never said." The unexplained gaps in the pattern haunted Denise almost as much as the kills themselves.

"Step eight," she said. "The trophy. Earl photographs something that belonged to the victim—a jacket, a ring, keys, anything personal. They develop the photo in the darkroom behind their house, then add it to the wall inside. You've seen it. Every photo on that wall represents someone who died here."

Grace looked at the photo wall with new horror. Denise followed her gaze. Sixty years of trophies, carefully curated and displayed. A gallery of the disappeared.

"That's the routine," Denise finished. "Eight steps. Identify, comfort, drug, isolate, kill, freeze, bury, photograph. They've perfected it over decades. And it's happening again. Right now. To all of you."

The booth was silent. Earl's humming continued in the background, some big-band tune from 1955.

Victor spoke first. "You said step three is drug the coffee."

"Yes."

"We've all been drinking coffee since yesterday afternoon."

The realization hit the group like ice water. Grace set down her pen. Ricky's cigarette stopped halfway to his mouth. Dale closed his eyes.

"Oh God," Grace whispered. "How much have we consumed?"

Denise felt tears pricking her eyes. "All of you. Multiple cups. I tried to warn you—I tried to tell you not to drink it, but you were already scared and I couldn't explain without Earl hearing and—"

"How do we feel the effects?" Victor interrupted. "What are the symptoms?"

"Drowsiness. Slightly slowed reflexes. Difficulty concentrating. Mild confusion or disorientation. Feels like you need sleep but can't quite settle." Denise watched their faces as recognition dawned. "You've been feeling it, haven't you?"

Victor's hand went to his eyes. "I thought it was exhaustion. We've been up all night."

"I've been nodding off," Grace admitted. "Couldn't focus on my notes earlier."

Ricky stood abruptly, then steadied himself against the table. "Dizzy. Reaction time's off. Noticed it when we were examining the graves but figured it was adrenaline crash."

"It's the sedative," Denise said. "You're in step three right now. Step four will come soon—they're waiting for one of you to be alone. That's when step five happens."

"How do we counteract it?" Dale asked.

"I don't know. I never saw anyone try. Coffee won't help—it's what's drugged. Water maybe, flushing your system. Time. But you don't have much time. Earl's been watching you all morning, waiting for the right moment."

As if summoned by his name, Earl appeared beside their booth with the coffee pot. His smile was wide and genuine-looking. "Top-ups? You folks look like you could use some caffeine. Long night, I know."

Everyone froze. The coffee pot steamed gently, dark and aromatic. Denise's stomach clenched.

"We're fine," Victor said flatly.

Earl's smile didn't waver. "Suit yourself. Let me know if you change your minds. Also got fresh pie cooling—cherry, made it this morning." He moved away, humming resumed.

"He knows," Ricky said quietly. "He knows that we know."

"He's been listening," Grace said. "We've been in the open this whole time."

Denise shook her head. "Doesn't matter. He always knows. Part of what this place does—it tells them things. They can sense when someone's figured it out, when resistance forms. Like the diner itself reports back to them."

"That's insane," Victor said.

"So is everything else about this place," Dale countered. "Why wouldn't it communicate with its parasites?"

Denise felt the familiar paralysis creeping back—thirty years of learned helplessness, of knowing resistance was futile. But she forced it down. These people were different. They'd found the freezer, documented the graves, understood the pattern. They had a chance.

"The sedative peaks around hour four," she said, refocusing. "After that, you're most vulnerable. That's when they strike. You need to stay together, stay alert, don't let anyone be isolated."

"And we need to stop consuming anything from this place," Grace added. "No food, no water, nothing."

"How long until we peak?" Ricky asked. "When did we last drink?"

Victor checked his watch. "I had coffee around six this morning. Two hours ago."

"Me too," Grace said.

"Same," Ricky confirmed.

"Two more hours then," Denise calculated. "Eight to ten o'clock. That's when you'll be slowest, most vulnerable. That's when they'll make their move."

"Then we make ours first," Victor said. "We have two hours to prepare, to arm ourselves, to be ready. We turn step four against them—when they expect us isolated and vulnerable, we're together and armed."

"They're strong," Denise warned. "Stronger than they look. The diner feeds them vitality. And they can't die—not really. They're already dead."

"Everything can be stopped," Ricky said. Combat certainty hardened his voice. "Dead or alive, they're physical. They can be restrained, injured, overwhelmed. We have numbers advantage."

Dale stood. "I have tools in my truck. Rope, wire, crowbar. We arm ourselves, prepare restraints, wait for them to approach. Turn their ambush into ours."

Grace gathered her documentation carefully. "And I'm preserving all of this. If we don't survive, at least there's a record. Someone will eventually find it."

Denise wanted to believe them. Wanted to think that understanding the routine meant they could break it. But thirty years of watching the routine succeed whispered that knowledge wasn't enough. The diner protected its parasites. Earl and Dotty had supernatural endurance and inhuman patience.

Still, she'd given them everything she knew. Every step, every detail, every vulnerability she'd observed over three decades. If anyone could break the pattern, maybe it was this group.

"One more thing," she said as they prepared to move. "The routine has never been interrupted. Not in thirty years. I don't know what happens if you fight back successfully, if you break the sequence. The diner might respond. It might get worse before it gets better."

"Can't get much worse than serial killers with meat hooks," Ricky muttered.

But Denise remembered 1967, the bikers who'd fought back. Remembered the diner glowing, humming with energy, feeding on violence. "Yes," she said quietly. "It can."

Across the diner, Dotty began humming harmony with Earl. Their movements synchronized as they cleaned, an eerie choreography of domestic normalcy. Waiting. Patient. Confident in their routine.

Two hours until the sedative peaked. Two hours to prepare. Two hours until step four became step five, unless they changed the pattern first.

The clock on the wall ticked steadily forward. The routine continued. But for the first time in thirty years, the victims knew what was coming.

That had to count for something.
