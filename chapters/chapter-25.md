# Chapter 25: Denise Calls the Police

Denise sat on gravel outside the payphone booth, letting the sun warm her face. Thirty years since she'd felt sunlight without terror. The morning was hot—desert summer. It felt like paradise.

Her fingers throbbed where the door had crushed them. Blood had dried brown. Real blood, real pain. Real proof she was alive, not another preserved corpse.

Inside the diner, through the broken window, she could see the group. Victor and Ricky reinforcing Earl's restraints. Grace treating Dale's arm. Five people who'd walked into hell and fought out. Maybe they'd saved each other.

The payphone stood behind her, receiver dangling. She'd made the call. Help was coming after thirty years.

But she needed to call again. Make it real, confirm it wasn't another delusion.

Denise stood on shaking legs, turned to the payphone. Picked up the receiver with bleeding fingers.

Dial tone.

Miracle. Steady, electronic, ordinary. The outside world, the normal world. Tears ran down her face—relief tears, freedom tears.

She dialed the operator with trembling fingers. The rotary dial clicked backward between digits.

"Operator, what's your emergency?"

A woman's voice. Real, human, kind. Normal.

"Police," Denise managed. Her voice cracked. "Murder. Mass murder. Route 66, Desert Diner, mile marker 247. Thirty-seven bodies. Please help us."

"Ma'am, officers are already en route to that location. ETA ninety minutes. Are you safe? Are you injured?"

"I'm—" Denise had to stop, had to breathe. "I'm alive. I'm outside. The killers are restrained. Five of us survived. Please hurry."

"Officers are coming as fast as possible. Can you stay on the line with me?"

"Yes." Denise slid down the side of the payphone booth, sat on gravel, receiver pressed to her ear like a lifeline. "Yes, I can stay."

"What's your name?"

"Denise. Denise Walker."

"Okay Denise, I'm Sarah. I'm here with you. Can you tell me about your injuries?"

"My fingers are crushed. From the door. But I'm okay. I'm alive. Do you understand? I'm alive."

"I understand," Sarah said. Her voice was patient, trained for crisis. "That's good. That's very good. Are the other survivors with you?"

"Inside the diner. Victor, Grace, Ricky, Dale. They're hurt but alive. They fought. They actually fought back and won."

"That's very brave. Help is coming. Ninety minutes. Can you hold for ninety minutes?"

Denise laughed—a sound between sob and hysteria. "I held for thirty years. I can hold ninety minutes."

Sarah paused. "Thirty years?"

"I've been trapped here since 1952. Earl and Dotty—the killers—kept me here. Made me watch. Made me serve victims their last meals. Thirty years. I watched them kill thirty-seven people. I memorized their names because someone had to remember them."

Pause. Typing in the background. Sarah documenting everything.

"Denise," Sarah said carefully. "You said 1952. That's thirty years ago."

"I know how it sounds. But I'm twenty-four. Arrived in 1952 at twenty-four. Still twenty-four. Haven't aged. The diner's outside time somehow. Earl and Dotty died in 1955 but they're still here. Check death certificates—Earl and Dotty Higgins, grease fire, 1955. Then check fingerprints when they're arrested. They'll match."

More typing. "I'm noting all this for officers. Can you tell me about the other survivors?"

"No. They arrived yesterday. Victor's a trucker, broke down on the highway. Grace is a researcher, doing dissertation work on Route 66. Ricky's a hitchhiker, Vietnam vet. Dale's the local mechanic. They're normal people who got trapped by accident. Like everyone else who disappeared here."

"And the thirty-seven bodies?"

"In the walk-in freezer. Preserved perfectly. Earl and Dotty kept them frozen until they could bury them. There's a mass grave behind the diner—Dale used ground-penetrating equipment to map it. Thirty-seven bodies matching thirty-seven victims from 1955 to now. Missing persons from twelve different states."

Sarah's professionalism was cracking slightly. "That's... Denise, that's going to require multiple agencies. FBI, state police, forensics. This is a major crime scene."

"I know. I watched it become one. Victim by victim, year by year. I tried to warn people. Tried to call police before. But the phone never worked. The diner controlled it. Only worked when the diner wanted it to work. And now..." Denise looked at the receiver in her hand. "Now it works. Because Earl and Dotty are restrained. Because the loop is broken. Because dawn came and changed the rules."

"Dawn changed the rules," Sarah repeated, typing. Denise could imagine the notes: *Subject experiencing possible psychotic episode, religious delusions, trauma response. Officers should approach with caution, evaluate mental state.*

"You don't believe me," Denise said. "That's okay. Nobody would believe me. But the bodies are real. The graves are real. Earl and Dotty are real. When officers arrive, they'll see."

"I believe you're traumatized," Sarah said. "And I believe something terrible happened. Officers will determine what when they arrive. Are you somewhere safe right now? Away from the suspects?"

"I'm outside. Twenty feet from the diner. Earl and Dotty are inside, restrained with electrical wire, bolted to booth fixtures. They can't reach me. Can't hurt me anymore. Can't make me serve coffee to people they're planning to kill."

The sun climbed higher. Denise watched shadows shrink as light strengthened. The neon "EAT" sign was off—just dark tubes on a metal frame, harmless in daylight. At night it had blazed blood-red, visible for miles, luring travelers to stop. Now it was just a sign.

"Denise, are you still with me?"

"Still here."

"Good. Keep talking to me. Tell me about the survivors inside. Are their injuries serious?"

"Victor has a shoulder wound and bruised ribs. Dale's forearm is slashed deep—he needs stitches, maybe surgery. Grace has bruises and possible fracture. Ricky's mostly exhausted, some bruising. They need medical attention but they're functional."

"Ambulances are coming with the police. Everyone will be treated." Sarah paused. "Denise, can I ask you something?"

"Yes."

"How did you survive thirty years? Trapped with killers, watching victims die—how did you not break completely?"

Denise considered the question. How had she survived? Hope, mostly. The hope that someday someone would fight back, would resist, would break the routine. The hope that Earl and Dotty would make a mistake. The hope that she'd find a way out.

And then, when hope faded, spite. Pure spite. Refusing to give Earl and Dotty the satisfaction of watching her collapse into madness or suicide. Refusing to become another victim. Surviving because dying would mean they won completely.

"I remembered names," Denise said finally. "Every victim. I memorized their names and stories. Made sure someone would remember them as people, not just bodies. That gave me purpose. Something to hold onto when everything else was horror."

"That's incredibly strong," Sarah said. "You're incredibly strong."

"I'm incredibly lucky," Denise corrected. "These five people—they fought when thirty-seven others couldn't. They had the right skills, the right determination, the right moment. And they treated me like I was worth saving. Not many people would have done that."

Inside the diner, Victor appeared at the broken window. He raised a hand—checking on her. Denise waved back. Victor nodded and disappeared inside.

"They're good people," Denise told Sarah. "They walked into nightmare and didn't break. Ricky with his combat training, Victor with his leadership, Grace with her documentation, Dale with his knowledge of this place. And Denise—" She stopped, realized she'd referred to herself in third person. Dissociation, probably. Thirty years of trauma expressing itself. "And me, with my thirty years of watching, finally doing something useful."

"You saved them," Sarah said. "From what you described—the flare gun, Dotty's knee—you turned the fight around."

"They saved me first. Gave me reason to fight instead of just survive. There's a difference."

The desert stretched endlessly beautiful. Denise had spent thirty years seeing it through diner windows, through the supernatural fog and wrongness that had infected this location. Now, sitting on gravel in full sunlight, it looked like the landscape she'd driven through in 1952. Open, honest, real.

"How long now?" she asked Sarah.

"Seventy-five minutes. First officers should arrive around eight-thirty."

Seventy-five minutes. Denise had waited thirty years. Seventy-five more minutes was nothing. Less than nothing. A gift.

"I can wait," she said. "I'm good at waiting."

"You shouldn't have to be," Sarah said. Sympathy in her voice, genuine human connection across phone lines. "No one should have to survive what you survived."

"But I did survive. That's what matters. I survived and they're stopped and help is coming. For the first time in thirty years, I can see tomorrow."

Inside the diner, she heard voices—the group talking, planning, staying alert. Earl and Dotty would be silent or speaking their predictions about how this would end. The diner would be settling into its daytime dormancy, supernatural aspects retreating before mundane sunlight.

But Denise was outside. In sunlight. On gravel that wasn't diner property. Breathing air that didn't taste of trapped time and frozen death. Holding a phone receiver that connected her to the normal world.

"Sarah," Denise said. "Thank you. For staying with me. For listening."

"It's my job. But you're welcome."

"When this is over—when police arrive and FBI takes over and everything becomes official—will they believe me? About the thirty years, the time loop, Earl and Dotty being dead since 1955?"

Sarah was quiet for a moment. "I don't know. The physical evidence will speak for itself—bodies, graves, fingerprints. But the impossible parts..." She trailed off.

"It's okay," Denise said. "I don't need everyone to believe. I just need to be free. And I am. Right now, sitting in sunlight, that's enough."

The phone line crackled with distance. Denise held the receiver tighter, unwilling to lose this connection to normalcy. Seventy-three minutes until police arrived. Seventy-three minutes of holding onto this moment—the first free moment she'd had in ten thousand days.

"I'm here," Sarah said. "I'll stay with you until officers arrive. You're not alone anymore, Denise."

Alone. Denise hadn't been truly alone in thirty years—Earl and Dotty were always there, always watching. But she'd been isolated, imprisoned, separated from humanity. Now, with Sarah's voice in her ear and the group inside the diner and help coming across the desert, she wasn't isolated anymore.

She was free. Trapped on location maybe, unable to walk away without knowing what happened. But free in the ways that mattered. Free to speak, free to act, free to exist as herself instead of the diner's helpless fixture.

The sun climbed higher. The desert heated up. And Denise sat with a phone to her ear, talking to Sarah about nothing important—weather, the view, small talk that meant everything after thirty years of horror—while waiting for police to arrive and make it all real.

Seventy minutes.

She could wait.

She was good at waiting.

But this time, she was waiting for rescue, not death. And that made all the difference.
