# Chapter 16: The Pattern of Disappearance

Grace spread the documentation across three tables she'd pushed together in the diner's back corner. Pre-dawn darkness pressed against the windows, and the fluorescent lights hummed overhead. Her hands moved methodically—photographs here, photocopied newspaper clippings there, her spiral notebook open to pages dense with dates.

The pattern was there. She could feel it the way she felt the shape of an argument before she'd written it down. Numbers didn't lie, even when everything else about this place did.

"Thirty-seven victims over twenty-seven years," she said, not looking up. Victor stood beside her, arms crossed. Ricky leaned against the wall, smoking his fifth cigarette of the night. Dale sat quietly at the counter. Denise hovered near the kitchen, far enough from Earl and Dotty's domain to speak freely, close enough to see their documentation of her nightmare. "That averages to about 1.4 victims per year."

"Doesn't sound like much when you say it like that," Ricky muttered. "Almost reasonable for serial killers."

Grace looked up sharply. "Except it's not consistent. Look." She pointed to her timeline, drawn in meticulous pencil with dates marked in red. "Three kills in October 1967. Then nothing for thirteen months. Five kills across 1970. Then two years of nothing. The clustering tells us something."

Victor leaned over the table, squinting at her handwriting. "What determines when they kill?"

"I think I know," Denise said quietly. She stepped closer, wringing her towel. "It's the traffic. When the highway was busy, they were selective. When it died..." She trailed off.

Grace felt the pieces clicking together. She pulled out the Route 66 traffic statistics she'd collected for her dissertation—dry data about vehicle counts and commercial decline that suddenly felt electric with relevance. "The Interstate Highway System. I-40 opened in sections through New Mexico between 1968 and 1975. Each time a section opened, traffic on this stretch of Route 66 dropped."

She traced the correlation with her finger. "1968: I-40 opens thirty miles north. Kills jump from one per year to three. 1972: Another section opens, traffic drops another forty percent. Five kills. 1978: Route 66 officially decommissioned in this region. Look at the frequency after that."

Victor's jaw tightened. "Seven kills in 1979. Six in 1980. Eight in 1981."

"They're starving," Grace said. The words felt strange, academic language applied to horror. "As traffic declined, they had to kill more frequently to maintain... whatever this is." She gestured at the diner around them, the impossible preservation, the wrongness soaked into the walls.

Dale spoke for the first time in an hour. "Thin places require sacrifice to maintain the boundary. Blood feeds the edge between worlds. My grandfather told me—some locations are wounds in the world. They need to be fed or they close."

Ricky stubbed out his cigarette forcefully. "You're saying the diner needs people to die? Like it's alive?"

"Everything's alive in its way," Dale said. "This place exists partially outside normal time. That takes energy. Death is energy. The oldest energy there is."

Grace's academic training rebelled against the metaphysics, but her evidence supported it. The data led here: to blood sacrifice and temporal loops and impossibility made manifest in chrome and neon.

"Denise," she said gently. "You've been here longest. Have you seen patterns in their behavior? Times when they seem... different?"

Denise sat down, the towel twisted tight in her hands. Her voice came out small, decades-compressed into a whisper. "1973. That's when I knew for sure they weren't human anymore."

The group waited. Outside, the desert wind picked up, sand hissing against the windows.

"Earl tried to stop killing," Denise continued. "I don't know why. Maybe he remembered what it was like to be human. Maybe he was tired. But for six months, he refused. Even when hitchhikers came through, even when truckers stopped overnight—he just served them breakfast and sent them on their way."

"What happened?" Grace asked, though part of her already knew.

"The diner started falling apart. Paint peeling. Chrome tarnishing. The neon sign flickering. And Earl and Dotty..." Denise's hands trembled. "They started aging. Not normal aging—decades in days. Earl's hair went white. Dotty's skin turned gray, papery. I watched them decay right in front of me. By the end of those six months, they looked ninety years old. Ancient."

Victor leaned forward. "But they're not ancient now."

"No." Denise's voice broke. "Because in July 1973, a hitchhiker showed up. Younger than me, maybe twenty-two. Just out of college, heading to California to visit his sister. His name was Michael Brenner." She looked at Victor. "I remember all their names."

The diner was silent except for the relentless hum of the fluorescent lights.

"Earl killed him that night. I saw it happen—Earl had held out for six months, but the diner was dying and taking them with it. Michael was in the bathroom. Earl followed him. It was fast. And the moment Michael died, everything changed. The chrome gleamed. The paint smoothed. The neon blazed bright. And Earl and Dotty..." She squeezed her eyes shut. "They were young again. Sixty years old instead of ninety. Back to how they looked the night they died in 1955."

Grace wrote furiously in her notebook, capturing every detail. "So they're not choosing to kill. Not entirely. They're being compelled."

"They're parasites," Ricky said flatly. "Feeding on people to survive."

"They're also victims," Dale said. "Trapped in this loop, forced to kill to maintain existence they never asked for. The fire should have ended them in 1955. Whatever brought them back made them into this."

Victor shook his head. "Don't care if they're victims. They've killed thirty-seven people. Whatever sympathy they deserve doesn't balance that."

"I'm not saying it does," Dale replied. "I'm saying hatred is simpler than truth. They're monsters and prisoners simultaneously."

Grace stared at her timeline, at the dates marching forward from 1955 to 1982, each mark representing a life ended to feed this place. The pattern was clear now: declining traffic meant increased killing meant the diner's desperate hunger. Earl and Dotty were the diner's tools, its appendages, simultaneously wielding and being wielded by forces older than highways or chrome or America itself.

"If the diner needs death to survive," Grace said slowly, working through the logic, "then stopping Earl and Dotty might not be enough. The place itself wants to persist. It'll find another way."

"Then we burn it down," Ricky said. "Destroy the whole thing. Complete the job that fire started in 1955."

Dale's expression darkened. "Fire brought them back last time. Might make it worse."

"What else do we do?" Ricky's voice rose. "Let them keep killing? Let the place keep feeding?"

"We document," Grace said. She tapped her notebook, her photographs, her meticulous timeline. "We make this so thoroughly documented that the authorities have to act. We turn this into evidence that can't be ignored. Mass grave, preserved bodies, dates and names. Make it impossible to cover up or dismiss."

Victor nodded slowly. "Get them arrested, locked up, studied. If they can't kill, the diner starves. Maybe it closes on its own. Maybe the loop breaks."

"And if it doesn't?" Ricky asked.

No one had an answer for that.

Grace returned to her timeline, adding notes about the 1973 incident, the correlation between traffic decline and killing frequency. Her dissertation had been about the death of Route 66, the way progress left certain places behind to decay. She'd never imagined that decay could be supernatural, that abandonment could create wounds in reality itself.

"There's something else," Denise said. "The victims they choose—they're always people who won't be missed right away. Hitchhikers without itineraries. Truckers on routes they don't usually drive. Drifters. Runaways. People society's already half-forgotten."

Grace felt a chill that had nothing to do with the pre-dawn temperature. "We fit that profile. All of us. Victor's on a route he doesn't usually take. Ricky's hitchhiking with no fixed destination. I'm doing dissertation research, could be anywhere. Dale's local but works alone. They selected us."

"Not selected," Victor said grimly. "Processed. Like inventory. They've been evaluating us since we arrived."

"But we're different from the others," Denise said, and for the first time, Grace heard hope in her voice. "We're a group. We know what they are. We found the freezer. The others were alone, unsuspecting. You have a chance they didn't."

Grace gathered her documentation carefully, sliding photographs into folders, making sure every piece of evidence was preserved. The pattern was complete now, laid bare in dates and traffic statistics and one woman's thirty-year witness testimony. Earl and Dotty Higgins were serial killers, but they were also symptoms of something larger—a place that refused to die, that fed on the forgotten, that existed in the cracks of American progress.

The sun would rise soon. They had decisions to make, actions to take. But first, they needed to understand what they were fighting.

"How hungry is it now?" Victor asked. "The diner, I mean. When's the last time they killed?"

Denise thought for a moment. "Three weeks. A trucker from Oregon. His rig broke down."

"Same as me," Victor said quietly.

"Same pattern," Grace confirmed, checking her notes. "Break down, strand, kill. If they're on a three-week cycle and it's been three weeks..."

"We're due," Ricky finished. "We're on the menu tonight."

Dale stood, stretched, moved to the window. The eastern horizon was beginning to lighten—not sunrise yet, but the promise of it. "Dawn changes things in thin places. Boundaries shift. Power fluctuates. If we're going to act, we do it at sunrise."

Grace packed her documentation into her bag, every photograph and photocopied article and handwritten note. Evidence for authorities, if they survived to present it. Evidence for history, if they didn't. The academic in her insisted on documentation even in the face of impossible horror—maybe especially then.

"I spent thirty years watching the pattern," Denise said softly. "Watching people arrive, watching them die, watching them become photographs on the wall. I learned their names from the belongings Earl and Dotty kept. I memorized dates from the labels in the freezer. I witnessed everything. And I was too afraid to act, too paralyzed to resist. But you're here now. And we have a chance to break this."

Grace met her eyes across the diner. "We'll break it. We'll document everything, stop them, get you out. This ends now."

Outside, the sky continued its slow brightening. The neon "EAT" sign pulsed against the fading darkness, red letters vivid as fresh blood. Somewhere in the kitchen, Earl hummed an old tune from 1955, the same few bars repeated endlessly. Dotty's footsteps moved in their eternal synchronized pattern.

The pattern was clear. The trap was understood. Now they just had to survive long enough to spring it.
