# Chapter 27: Impossible Evidence

Grace sat in the hospital waiting room, her arm in a proper sling now, X-rays confirming a hairline fracture. Minor, compared to what could have happened. Compared to what happened to thirty-seven others who never made it to a hospital.

The FBI had arrived three hours ago. Special Agent Katherine Rhodes, mid-forties, sharp-eyed, experienced. She'd walked through the crime scene, examined the evidence, interviewed the survivors. Now she sat across from Grace with a recorder and a legal pad filled with notes.

"Let me make sure I understand," Rhodes said. Her voice was measured, professional. "You're claiming Earl and Dotty Higgins, who according to official records died in 1955, murdered thirty-seven people between 1955 and 1982?"

"That's correct," Grace said. She had her documentation ready—photocopies of death certificates, photographs, her detailed timeline. Academic training at work. "I have proof."

Rhodes examined the papers Grace handed her. The 1955 death certificates for Earl and Dotty Higgins. Newspaper clippings about the grease fire that killed them. Burial records. All official, all verified.

"These are legitimate documents," Rhodes confirmed. "Earl and Dotty Higgins did die in 1955. Autopsied, buried, death certificates filed. This is in the system."

"Now check the fingerprints," Grace said. "From Earl and Dotty currently in custody."

Rhodes pulled another file. "Fingerprints were processed at county jail two hours ago. They've been uploaded to AFIS database." She compared them to the 1955 records. Her expression shifted. "These match exactly."

"I know."

"That's impossible. Even identical twins don't have identical fingerprints. These are the same person, same fingerprints, taken twenty-seven years apart. That can't happen."

"But it did," Grace said. "Look at the dental records."

Rhodes flipped to another section of the file. Dental X-rays taken at the county facility, compared to post-mortem dental records from 1955. "Perfect match. Same teeth, same fillings, same bone structure. Down to individual root patterns."

"DNA testing was ordered," Grace added. "Results will take weeks. But I predict they'll match 1955 autopsy samples. Earl and Dotty Higgins died in 1955 and continued killing through 1982. Impossible, but documented."

Rhodes set down her files. "Ms. Martinez, I've worked federal cases for eighteen years. Serial killers, organized crime, terrorism. I've seen terrible things. But I've never seen physically impossible things. People don't come back from death. They don't stop aging. They don't maintain identical fingerprints across decades."

"I don't have an explanation," Grace said. "I'm a folklorist, not a physicist. But I have documentation. Photos of Earl and Dotty spanning sixty years where they don't age. Death certificates proving they died. Fingerprints proving they're the same people. The evidence is contradictory but real."

Rhodes pulled out another file. "The bodies in the freezer have been preliminarily identified. Thirty-seven victims, like you said. Missing persons from twelve states, cases dating back to 1956. Dental records, jewelry, clothing—all matching open cases. Some of these people have been missing for decades. Families gave up hope years ago."

"And now they'll have closure," Grace said quietly.

"Complicated closure. Their loved ones were murdered by people who officially died before some of the victims disappeared. How do I explain that in a report?"

"You report what's provable. Bodies recovered, victims identified, suspects in custody. The impossible parts..." Grace gestured helplessly. "Maybe label them unexplained."

Rhodes made notes. "The graves behind the diner match your ground-penetrating scans. Forensic anthropology team is excavating now. Preliminary count confirms thirty-seven burial sites. This is the largest serial killer site in New Mexico history."

"Earl and Dotty were very efficient," Grace said. Thirty years of routine, perfected through repetition. The horror of that efficiency hit her again—each murder reduced to steps, executed smoothly.

"Tell me about the diner itself," Rhodes said. "Your statement mentions time anomalies, supernatural cold, the building being 'aware.' Clarify that."

Grace chose her words carefully. "The diner exists in a location with unusual properties. Time doesn't flow normally there. Clocks run backward, temperatures fluctuate impossibly, electronics malfunction. We documented watches stopping, condensation forming words, the building responding to events. Dale Porter—the local mechanic—describes it as a 'thin place' based on indigenous traditions. A location where normal physics don't fully apply."

"That's not scientifically possible."

"I agree. But it's what we experienced. Five people, independently verifying the same observations. Our watches all malfunctioned identically. We all experienced the same temperature drops, the same atmospheric changes. Mass hallucination doesn't explain physical evidence like frozen condensation patterns or electronics failing simultaneously."

Rhodes tapped her pen on the legal pad. "The Bureau will send scientists. Physicists, geologists, specialists in environmental anomalies. They'll study the location, try to find rational explanations."

"Good luck to them," Grace said. "I spent years researching Route 66 folklore. Every highway has ghost stories, urban legends, exaggerated tales. I dismissed them as superstition and narrative patterns. Now I know some of those stories were real. Some of those disappearances weren't people starting new lives. They were people being murdered by things that shouldn't exist."

"Earl and Dotty are very much physical," Rhodes countered. "They're in custody, in cells, under observation. They eat, they move, they respond to stimuli. Whatever they are, they're corporeal."

"Corporeal corpses," Grace said. "That's the contradiction. They have bodies but no life signs that make sense. Ask the medical examiner. Body temperature wrong, no detectable pulse, respiration minimal. They function but they're not alive in any conventional sense."

Rhodes flipped through medical reports. "Preliminary examination notes describe them as 'anomalous.' Body temperature 68 degrees Fahrenheit—hypothermia range for living humans, but they're functional. Heart rate twelve beats per minute—fatal for normal humans, sustainable for them. They don't appear to need food or water, though they'll consume it if offered. Blood analysis shows..." She paused. "This can't be right."

"What?"

"Blood chemistry indicates cellular death dating approximately twenty-seven years ago. As if the blood was preserved immediately post-mortem and is somehow still circulating. The medical examiner flagged this as equipment malfunction and reran the tests. Same results."

"They died in 1955," Grace said. "Their bodies remember. They're animated corpses sustained by whatever force runs that diner. The thin place, the loop, the wound in reality—whatever terminology you prefer."

Rhodes closed the files. "This case will never close properly. Evidence points to mass murder by suspects who are legally dead. Physical proof contradicts official records. The crime scene exhibits properties that violate known physics. Even if we convict Earl and Dotty—and conviction requires them to be legally alive—families will have questions we can't answer."

"But they'll have bodies," Grace said. "They'll have confirmation their loved ones didn't abandon them, didn't choose to disappear. They were victims of something terrible. That's closure, even if it's incomplete."

Rhodes nodded slowly. "You're right. Thirty-seven families get their deceased back. Get to bury them properly. That matters more than understanding how people murdered by corpses."

"What happens to Earl and Dotty? Legally, I mean."

"That's complicated. They're being held on thirty-seven counts of first-degree murder. But prosecution requires proving they're competent to stand trial, which requires proving they're alive. If medical science determines they're not alive in any conventional sense..." Rhodes trailed off.

"They get classified as unexplained and held indefinitely?"

"Probably. Federal custody, studied, contained. They won't kill again. That's what matters."

Grace thought about Denise, trapped for thirty years. About the loop that had held her even after Earl and Dotty were restrained. Some prisons weren't legal constructs—they were metaphysical realities.

"What about the diner?" Grace asked. "Will it be demolished?"

"Under discussion. It's a crime scene, will remain secured for months during investigation. After that..." Rhodes shrugged. "Demolition might trigger something worse, according to your statements. The 1955 fire brought Earl and Dotty back. Destroying the building might repeat that pattern."

"So it stays standing."

"Probably. Marked as dangerous, access restricted, monitored. Maybe it'll just be a diner again. Maybe the thin place closed when Earl and Dotty were removed. Or maybe it's waiting for the next travelers to stop for coffee."

Grace felt cold. Her dissertation research had focused on dead highways and vanished America. She'd documented dozens of abandoned locations along Route 66—ghost towns, ruined motels, closed diners. She'd treated them as nostalgic artifacts, evidence of economic change and cultural shift.

Now she wondered how many of those ruins were just ruins. And how many were thin places, waiting.

"One more thing," Rhodes said. "Denise Walker. Her story is... problematic."

"Because she claims thirty years imprisonment without aging?"

"Exactly. Her ID is from 1952—we verified it's legitimate, not forged. But she appears twenty-four years old. Medical examination confirms apparent age mid-twenties. Developmentally, biologically, she's a young woman. But she remembers thirty years in detail, knows victims from decades past, describes events from 1952 forward."

"She's another impossible element," Grace said.

"Yes. And she can't leave the area. We've tested it. At a certain point, she physically cannot move forward. Invisible barrier, like she described. It's been verified by multiple officers. Denise Walker is imprisoned by something we can't see, measure, or explain."

"What will you do for her?"

"Accommodate. She'll live on-site in provided housing, receive support, have freedom within the boundary. It's not ideal. But it's better than the diner."

Grace thought of Denise, free from Earl and Dotty but still trapped by the place itself. Thirty years of imprisonment continuing in new form. The injustice of it burned.

"Keep trying to break the boundary," Grace said. "Don't give up on her."

"We won't," Rhodes promised. "FBI will assign resources. Scientists, specialists, anyone who might help. Denise Walker deserves freedom after what she survived."

The interview concluded. Rhodes gathered her files, promised Grace would receive copies of all reports once classified sections were redacted. The case would span agencies, take years to fully process. But the immediate work was done—victims recovered, suspects contained, survivors safe.

Grace walked outside into New Mexico sunlight. The hospital parking lot was normal, mundane, real. No supernatural cold, no temporal anomalies, no impossible horrors. Just asphalt and cars and ordinary afternoon heat.

But somewhere fifty miles away, the Desert Diner still stood. Crime scene tape fluttering in desert wind. Evidence markers flagging where bodies had lain. The thin place dormant but not dead.

And Grace had documentation proving impossible things were real.

Her dissertation would need extensive revisions.
