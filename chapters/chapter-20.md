# Chapter 20: Planning the Dawn Strike

Ricky's training kicked in the moment Victor said "fight." The debate was over. Now came the part he understood: tactical planning, weapons assessment, combat preparation. The Army had taught him objectives, assets, timing. This was just another mission. An impossible mission, but still a mission.

"Dawn," he said immediately. "We wait for dawn. Dale's right about thin places—boundaries shift at sunrise. If they're weaker then, that's when we strike."

Victor nodded. "That gives us roughly six hours to prepare. It's mid-morning now, call it ten o'clock. Sunrise tomorrow is around six. Six hours to arm ourselves, plan the attack, rest enough to counter the sedative."

"Assignments," Ricky said. "Victor and I take Earl. He's bigger, stronger. We need combined strength to bring him down."

"Grace and I take Dotty," Dale said. "She's smaller but faster."

"And me?" Denise asked.

"Payphone. The moment we engage, you run. Call police, ambulance, anyone. If we succeed, we need authorities fast. If we fail..." He didn't finish. If they failed, she'd need to warn whoever came after.

Grace had her notebook out again, sketching a rough floor plan of the diner. "Engagement location? Kitchen, dining room, outside?"

"Dining room gives us space," Ricky said. "Kitchen has weapons for them. Outside means desert—we lose lighting, they might have advantages in darkness. We want controllable environment with escape routes and witness potential."

"Dining room," Victor agreed. "Near the front door so Denise can get out fast."

Ricky stood, fighting the drowsiness the sedative caused. "Weapons inventory. We need to arm everyone. Non-lethal if possible, per Victor's minimum violence rule. But effective."

They moved to Dale's tow truck. The bed contained decades of tools: crowbars, tire irons, heavy wrenches, coils of steel cable, electrical wire. Dale pulled out a toolbox.

"Wire for restraints," he said, holding up a thick spool. "Rated for two hundred pounds. Enough to hold human-sized bodies."

"They're stronger than human," Denise reminded them.

"Multiple layers then," Ricky said, grabbing three spools. "Triple-wrap limbs, secure to fixed objects. Booth fixtures are bolted—those'll work."

Victor tested a crowbar's weight. "This for leverage. Force them down, create openings for wire."

Grace selected a tire iron, hefting it uncertainly. "I've never hit anyone."

"Aim for legs, shoulders, non-lethal targets," Ricky instructed. "Don't think of it as hitting a person. Think of it as defensive strikes against threats. Your brain will make the distinction when you need it to."

Dale pulled out a flare gun—the one Denise had used before—and checked the remaining flares. "Three left. One for signal if needed. Two for defense. Fire is their weakness. Earl remembered burning to death in 1955. That fear is useful."

"Psychological warfare," Ricky approved. "Good thinking."

They carried the armament back to the diner. Earl and Dotty were in the kitchen, visible through the service window. Cooking, cleaning, maintaining their routine. If they noticed the group arming themselves, they gave no indication. But Ricky's instincts said they knew. Predators always knew when prey fought back.

"Combat roles," he said, arranging weapons on a back table. "Victor, you're anchor. Pin Earl, keep him stationary. I'll work restraints while you hold."

Victor nodded.

"Dale, you control Dotty. Tire iron keeps distance while Grace works wire. Don't let her inside your guard. She's fast and has knives."

"Disarm immediately," Dale said.

"Agreed. Disarm first, restrain second." Ricky turned to Denise. "You run when we engage. Don't look back, don't hesitate. Payphone is twelve yards from the door. You know where it is in darkness?"

"I could find it blind," Denise said. "I've tried to reach it enough times."

"This time you'll make it." Ricky said it with combat certainty, the voice that convinced soldiers to follow orders into danger. "We'll create the opening. You take it."

Grace was sketching attack patterns, trying to visualize the confrontation. "What if they separate? If Earl goes one direction and Dotty another?"

"They won't," Denise said. "They move together. Always. Part of how the diner controls them—they're synchronized. A single entity in two bodies."

"Good," Ricky said. "Means we can predict their positioning. They'll defend each other, prioritize mutual support over individual advantage. That's exploitable."

Victor sat heavily in a booth, fatigue showing. The sedative was still working through their systems. "How do we stay awake until dawn? We're all running on fumes and drugs."

"Rotation," Ricky said. "Two awake, three sleep at a time. Never everyone unconscious. Rotate every ninety minutes. Less efficient than full sleep but safer."

Dale pulled out a thermos from his truck. "Water. Clean water from my garage, brought yesterday. Nothing from the diner touches your lips from now until sunrise. Hydration helps flush sedatives."

They passed the thermos around, each drinking deep. The water was warm and tasted like plastic, but it was safe. Untainted. Ricky felt the psychological relief of consuming something that wouldn't further compromise them.

"Timing of strike," Victor said. "Sunrise is around six. But Dale said false dawn affects thin places. That's what, thirty minutes before?"

"Five-thirty," Dale confirmed. "Sky begins lightening, boundary between night and day starts shifting. Power fluctuates."

"We move at five-thirty then," Ricky decided. "Maximum confusion, minimum strength for them, light enough to see but dark enough they still have some capability. We want them off-balance, not fully depowered."

"Why not wait for full sun?" Grace asked.

"Because if we wait, they might strike first," Ricky said. "They're on a timeline too—sedative peaks soon. They'll make their move. We need to move first, before we're completely compromised."

The group fell silent. Ricky pulled out a cigarette, then reconsidered. His hands needed to be steady. He pocketed it unlit.

"Rehearsal," he said. "Walk through positions, movements, coordination. Muscle memory for when adrenaline hits."

They spent the next hour practicing. Victor and Ricky grappled with booth fixtures, learning optimal angles. Grace and Dale practiced wire-work, wrapping limbs efficiently. Denise timed her run—twelve seconds in daylight, probably fifteen in darkness.

"Again," Ricky said each time. "Faster. Smoother. When it's real, everything takes longer and nothing goes perfect."

Outside, the sun climbed higher. The desert heat built, making the diner's air conditioning work harder. Through the service window, Earl's whistling continued. Dotty moved in her synchronized pattern. Waiting.

Ricky checked his watch: eleven-thirty. They had been preparing for ninety minutes. Eighteen more hours until strike time. An eternity and an instant simultaneously.

"Rest rotation," he announced. "Victor, Dale, Denise—sleep first. Grace and I take watch. Ninety minutes, then switch."

"I can't sleep," Denise said.

"Try anyway. Your body needs recovery. Even lying down with eyes closed helps."

The three moved to booths. Victor was asleep in minutes—trucker adaptation. Dale meditated more than slept, breathing slow. Denise lay curled small, eyes open, staring at nothing.

Ricky took position where he could watch the kitchen and the front door simultaneously. Grace sat across from him, her hands moving through nervous patterns on the table.

"You think this'll work?" she asked quietly.

"It has to," Ricky said. "No other choice."

"That's not the same as yes."

He considered lying, then decided she deserved truth. "I've been in combat. Real combat, not training. And I learned that plans never survive contact with enemy. But having a plan is still better than no plan. Gives you framework to improvise from when everything goes wrong."

"When. Not if."

"When," Ricky confirmed. "Something will go wrong. They'll be stronger than expected, or faster, or the wire won't hold, or Denise won't make it to the phone. We adapt. That's combat."

Grace absorbed this. "I'm terrified."

"Good. Fear keeps you alert. Just channel it into action when the moment comes."

They sat in silence, watching Earl and Dotty move through their eternal routine. Ricky's mind ran through contingencies, backup plans, failure scenarios. In Vietnam, he'd learned to think three moves ahead. If plan A fails, go to plan B. If plan B fails, improvise plan C while implementing plan D.

Here, plan A was restrain them at dawn. Plan B was injure them enough to escape. Plan C was survive long enough for authorities. Plan D was hope Denise survived to warn others.

None involved victory. Just varying degrees of acceptable loss.

The afternoon wore on. Ricky watched the light change through the windows, shadows shifting. His internal clock—honed by night patrols—tracked time without checking his watch. Ninety minutes. Time to rotate.

He woke Victor with a hand on the shoulder, the gesture careful to avoid startling. Combat veterans didn't wake easily to sudden touches.

"Your watch," Ricky said quietly.

Victor sat up, oriented himself quickly. "Anything?"

"Nothing. They're waiting like we're waiting."

"Mexican standoff until dawn."

"Exactly."

Ricky lay down in the booth Victor had vacated. The vinyl was warm, smelling of old smoke and grease. He closed his eyes, and sleep came immediately—the soldier's ability to rest before battle, knowing consciousness needed to be rationed.

He dreamed of the diner burning, Earl and Dotty laughing in flames, and the neon sign glowing brighter as everything else turned to ash.

When he woke for his next watch rotation, the sun was setting. The sky bled red through the western windows. They'd made it halfway to dawn. Halfway to confrontation.

Outside, the desert darkness gathered. Inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed with increasing intensity. The diner seemed to hum, a frequency just below hearing. Earl and Dotty had stopped moving. They stood behind the counter, perfectly still, watching the group with expressions that had moved beyond human into something patient and hungry.

The jukebox cut out mid-song. The silence was absolute.

"They know," Grace whispered.

Ricky nodded. "They've always known. Now they're done pretending."

Dotty smiled, her teeth too white in the fluorescent glare. "You folks planning to leave soon?" Her voice had flattened, the cheerful diner-speak accent gone. "Road's dangerous at night. Best to stay. Stay for breakfast. We'll cook something special."

Earl's head turned with mechanical precision. "On the house. Everything on the house."

The lights flickered. The temperature dropped despite the desert heat outside. The photograph wall seemed to pulse in peripheral vision, decades of faces watching.

"Dawn," Victor said quietly. "We wait for dawn."

"Smart," Earl said. His voice had changed too, emotionless and certain. "But dawn is seven hours away. And the sedative peaks in one hour. You'll be vulnerable then. Slow. Easy."

They knew. Of course they knew. The diner told them everything.

Ricky checked his weapons, his restraints, his prepared positions. Seven hours. Then false dawn. Then the strike. Seven hours of waiting while Earl and Dotty watched with dead eyes and patient hunger.

The routine had never been broken. But dawn was coming. And with it, the chance to break thirty years of killing.

Or the chance to become victims thirty-eight through forty-two.

Seven hours to find out which.
