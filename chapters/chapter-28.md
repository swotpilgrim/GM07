# Chapter 28: Dale's Explanation

Dale sat in the FBI interview room, his arm properly stitched and bandaged, forty-two stitches total. The knife wound had been deep, requiring surgery, but he'd live. He'd survived worse. The desert didn't give up its children easily.

Agent Rhodes sat across from him, her recorder running. But this interview felt different from the others. Less interrogation, more consultation. She'd learned that Dale understood things the FBI didn't.

"Tell me about thin places," Rhodes said. "From the beginning. What your grandfather taught you."

Dale gathered his thoughts, choosing words carefully. The concepts didn't translate easily into English, into federal bureaucracy, into the framework of people who'd never experienced the desert's older truths.

"My grandfather was Laguna Pueblo," he began. "Born before New Mexico was even a state. He remembered when the old ways were just... the ways. Before highways, before cars, when the desert was crossed on foot or horseback and you respected its power because it could kill you easy."

"He taught you about supernatural locations?"

"He taught me the desert has rules. Most places follow one set of rules—gravity works this way, time flows that way, life and death are separate. But some places have different rules. Thinner rules. Places where the boundary between worlds isn't as solid."

Rhodes made notes. "Worlds meaning what? Alternate dimensions? Spiritual realms?"

"Both. Neither. Language fails here. Think of it like..." Dale paused, searching for metaphor. "Fabric. Reality is fabric, woven tight. Most places, the weave is solid. But thin places have loose threads, gaps in the weave. Things slip through. Dead don't stay dead. Time doesn't flow straight. The living get trapped. The desert shows through."

"And the Desert Diner is one of these thin places?"

"Yes. Probably always was, even before the diner. Indigenous peoples avoided that location for generations. My grandfather said it was a wound—place where something terrible happened long ago, and the land remembers. The trauma stays in the ground, in the air, waiting."

Rhodes flipped through files. "We've researched the history. That location was empty desert until 1948 when Earl and Dotty built their diner. No recorded events before that. No battles, no disasters, nothing that would create 'trauma.'"

"Recorded by who?" Dale asked. "Your records go back maybe two hundred years. This land has memory going back ten thousand. What happened there might have been before Europeans arrived. Before writing. But the land remembers."

"So the thin place existed before Earl and Dotty?"

"Yes. They built on it by accident or purpose—doesn't matter. Building there changed things. Structure became part of the place, integrated into the wound. When they died in 1955, the thin place brought them back because it needed them. Needed servants, extensions, ways to feed itself."

"Feed itself how?"

"Death," Dale said simply. "Thin places require energy to maintain the boundary. Blood sacrifice is the oldest energy. Earl and Dotty provided that, intentionally or as compulsion. Each death strengthened the thin place, made it more stable, more permanent."

Rhodes set down her pen. "You're describing the diner as a living entity."

"Not living. Existing. There's a difference. It's not conscious like you or me. More like... a whirlpool. Water swirls because of forces underneath, not because the water decides to swirl. The thin place exists because reality is damaged there. It pulls things in, holds them, uses them. Earl and Dotty got caught in the current."

"And Denise Walker?"

"Also caught. But differently. Earl and Dotty died and came back. Denise lived and got frozen—time stopped affecting her, aging stopped, she became part of the place's structure. Not dead, not fully alive. Suspended."

"Can she be freed?"

Dale was quiet for a long moment. "I don't know. She's been integrated for thirty years. The boundary might recognize her as permanent fixture now. Like trying to remove a load-bearing wall—the whole structure adjusts around her."

"That's not acceptable," Rhodes said firmly. "We can't leave her imprisoned."

"I agree. But wanting something and achieving it are different. The thin place doesn't negotiate. It doesn't care about human justice or fairness. It exists, and it keeps what it catches."

Rhodes tapped her files. "Our scientists will study it. Find rational explanations."

"Your scientists will fail," Dale said, not unkindly. "They'll measure electromagnetic fields, radiation levels, geological composition. They'll find anomalies they can't explain and declare it hoax or instrument malfunction. Western science doesn't have vocabulary for this."

"Then what do we do?"

"Respect it. Mark the location dangerous. Don't try to destroy it—that might make it worse. Don't try to study it too aggressively—it might respond. Just... contain it. Keep people away. Let it sleep."

"And if it doesn't sleep? If it pulls in more travelers?"

"Then you respond like you did this time. Rescue who you can. Document what happens. Accept that some things can't be fully solved."

Rhodes looked frustrated. "That's not how the FBI works. We close cases. We find answers."

"Some questions don't have answers humans can understand," Dale said. "My grandfather told me: the desert is older than humanity, will outlast humanity, operates on timescales we can't comprehend. Thin places are the desert showing through. You don't close desert. You survive it or you don't."

"You sound fatalistic."

"I sound realistic. I've lived here forty-five years. I've seen things that shouldn't exist, survived encounters that should have killed me. I know the desert's power. Respect it or it'll break you."

Rhodes switched topics. "Earl and Dotty. What are they now? In your understanding?"

"Revenant. That's the old word. Dead but walking. Corpses animated by the thin place's energy. They have bodies, memories, intelligence. But the humanity burned out in 1955. What walks around wearing their skin is something else—the thin place's immune system, defending itself through physical agents."

"Can they die again?"

"Maybe. Probably. But would it matter? The place brought them back once. Might do it again. Or might find new servants. The threat isn't Earl and Dotty specifically. It's the location itself."

Rhodes closed her files. "The Bureau will want to keep Earl and Dotty in custody indefinitely. Study them, understand what they are."

"They won't like that. Not the studying—they don't seem to care about dignity. But the separation from the thin place. They're extensions of it. Distance might weaken them, might cause them pain. Or might cause the thin place to act."

"Act how?"

"I don't know. Pull them back somehow. Send something else. Thin places adapt. They've existed for thousands of years by adapting. Don't assume removing Earl and Dotty solved the problem permanently."

Rhodes looked at Dale for a long moment. "You knew about this location. Before Victor and the others stopped there. You knew it was dangerous."

"Yes."

"Why didn't you warn people? Put up signs, contact authorities, something?"

Dale had expected this question. "Who would have believed me? I'm a mechanic on Route 66 talking about supernatural death traps. You wouldn't have believed until you saw the bodies. Nobody believes until they see."

"You could have tried."

"I did try. Told local sheriff in 1965. He investigated, found nothing wrong. Ate breakfast at the diner, said Earl and Dotty were nice people. Case closed. Tried again in 1974. New sheriff, same result. By 1980, I stopped trying. The thin place protects itself. Makes people not see, not believe, not act. Only worked this time because Victor and the others fought back from inside. Broke the pattern before the place could erase them."

"You feel guilty," Rhodes observed.

"Every day. Thirty-seven victims. Maybe if I'd been more persistent, done more, some of them would have survived."

"Or you'd be victim thirty-eight."

"Maybe." Dale looked at his bandaged arm. Forty-two stitches from Dotty's knife. "But I survived this. Maybe I would have survived earlier attempts."

"You did what you could with the knowledge and resources you had," Rhodes said. "Don't carry guilt that isn't yours. Earl and Dotty killed those people. The thin place trapped them. You're not responsible for supernatural forces beyond your control."

Dale appreciated the sentiment, but the guilt remained. Knowledge was responsibility. He'd known the diner was dangerous and let people keep stopping there because warning them seemed futile. That was a choice, and choices had consequences.

"What happens now?" Dale asked. "To the diner, to Denise, to Earl and Dotty?"

"Diner remains secured indefinitely. Denise receives support and accommodation within her boundary. Earl and Dotty stay in federal custody pending... whatever legal framework we can create for undead serial killers." Rhodes almost smiled. "That sentence should never have to be spoken."

"Welcome to thin places."

"The five of you will be asked to consult going forward. FBI doesn't have experts in supernatural phenomena. You're the closest we have."

"I'm a mechanic."

"You're a mechanic who understands thin places, survived Earl and Dotty, and helped stop thirty-seven years of killing. That makes you valuable."

Dale nodded slowly. "I'll help if I can. But I'm not leaving New Mexico. Desert's my home."

"We'll work around that." Rhodes stood, offered her hand. Dale shook it. "Thank you for your cooperation. And for your knowledge. This case would be even more impossible without you."

"It's still impossible," Dale said. "But at least it's documented impossible."

After Rhodes left, Dale sat alone in the interview room, thinking about his grandfather's lessons. The desert was eternal. Thin places were eternal. Humanity passed through briefly, creating small disruptions and calling them important. But the desert would outlast all of them, would be here long after FBI and diners and highways had turned to dust.

The thin place at mile marker 247 would wait. Dormant maybe, contained maybe. But waiting.

And someday, someone would forget the warnings. Someone would rebuild there, or camp there, or just stop for shelter from a storm.

And the desert would take them.

Because that's what thin places did. That's what they'd always done.

Dale left the interview room, walked outside into New Mexico afternoon heat. The desert stretched forever under cloudless sky. Beautiful and deadly. Honest about both.

He'd survived the thin place. Barely. With help. With luck.

Next time—and there would be a next time, somewhere, somewhen—someone else would have to be just as lucky.

Or become victim number thirty-eight.
