# Chapter 26: Authorities Arrive

Victor heard the sirens before he saw the vehicles. The sound carried across the desert—distant at first, then growing, multiple units converging. He'd been watching the highway through the broken window for the last twenty minutes, waiting. Now they were coming.

"Ricky," he called. "Authorities incoming. Two minutes."

Ricky moved to the window, crowbar still in hand despite exhaustion. "Multiple vehicles. Police, ambulance. Looks like county sheriff."

Dale was sitting in a booth, pale from blood loss but conscious. Grace had his arm elevated, pressure bandage holding. She looked up at Victor's announcement. "Finally."

Earl and Dotty sat in their restraints, still smiling. They'd been quiet for the last hour, conserving energy or waiting for something. Victor didn't care which. Help was here. The nightmare was ending.

A convoy appeared on Route 66—three police cruisers, two ambulances, a sheriff's vehicle. They pulled into the gravel lot, kicking up dust. Doors opened. Officers emerged, hands near weapons, assessing the situation.

Victor stepped to the door, hands visible, moving slowly. "Victor Brennan. I'm one of the survivors. No active threat inside. Two suspects restrained. Multiple injured requiring medical attention."

The lead officer was county sheriff—older man, weathered, competent-looking. He approached carefully, hand on his sidearm. "Sheriff Martinez. You called this in?"

"Denise Walker called. She's outside by the payphone. We're inside—five survivors, two suspects restrained. And evidence. A lot of evidence."

Sheriff Martinez signaled his deputies to secure the perimeter. "What kind of evidence?"

"Mass murder. Thirty-seven victims. Bodies in the walk-in freezer. Mass grave behind the building. You're going to need FBI, forensics, multiple agencies."

The sheriff's expression shifted from caution to disbelief. "That's a serious claim."

"I know. It's all true. Every word." Victor gestured toward the diner. "Come see for yourself."

Two deputies entered first, weapons drawn. They saw Earl and Dotty restrained in the booths—elderly couple, wire-bound, watching with too-calm eyes. Saw the bloodstained floor, broken windows, evidence of violent struggle.

"Suspects secured," one deputy confirmed.

Sheriff Martinez entered, followed by paramedics. His eyes tracked across the scene—the group's injuries, the damaged interior, Earl and Dotty's unnatural stillness.

"Medical first," he ordered. Paramedics moved to Dale immediately, assessing his arm wound. Others checked Victor, Grace, Ricky. Professional efficiency taking over.

"Sheriff," Victor said. "The freezer. You need to see the freezer."

Martinez looked at him. "Show me."

Victor led him to the walk-in. The door was still propped open from when they'd first discovered it. He stepped back, let the sheriff look inside.

The reaction was exactly what Victor expected. Martinez froze. Took two steps back. Hand went to his mouth. Even decades of law enforcement hadn't prepared him for this.

"Jesus Christ," Martinez breathed. "How many?"

"Thirty-seven bodies. All labeled with dates. 1955 to 1982."

Martinez pulled his radio. "Dispatch, this is Sheriff Martinez. I need immediate FBI notification. Mass homicide scene, multiple victims. Send crime scene unit, medical examiner, everyone. This is real."

Another deputy vomited in the parking lot after seeing the freezer. A third stood guard at the door, face pale, looking anywhere except inside.

Earl spoke from his restraints. "Sheriff Martinez. Third generation Martinez family in this county. Your grandfather used to stop here in the 1960s. Good man. Always tipped well."

Martinez turned to Earl, expression hard. "Who are you?"

"Earl Higgins. This is my wife, Dotty. We've run this diner since 1948. Well, mostly since 1948. There was an interruption in 1955, but we came back. Couldn't stay away from the work."

"The work," Martinez repeated. "You're confessing to murder?"

"We're explaining our purpose. People come to this place to disappear. We help them disappear permanently. Service, really. The desert wants certain things. We provide them."

Martinez stared, then looked at Victor. "Is he insane?"

"Worse," Victor said. "Check his fingerprints. Check his identity. Earl and Dotty Higgins died in a grease fire in 1955. Their death certificates are on file. Check."

"That's impossible."

"Everything about this place is impossible. But the bodies are real. Check those first. Then check fingerprints. Then try to make it make sense."

Paramedics were working on Dale, starting IV fluids, preparing to transport. Grace had superficial injuries—bruising, possible fracture needing X-rays. Victor's shoulder required stitches but could wait. Ricky refused treatment beyond cleaning his wounds.

Outside, Denise was surrounded by officers and paramedics. Victor could see her through the window—gesturing, explaining, probably telling them the same impossible story she'd told the operator. Her crushed fingers were being treated, bandaged.

The crime scene unit arrived—white vans, serious-looking people with cameras and evidence kits. The medical examiner pulled up in an unmarked sedan. Forensic photographers began documenting everything: blood patterns on the floor, wire restraints, broken windows, the supernatural cold that still lingered in corners. Every detail captured, measured, recorded. The scene was transforming from desperate survival into official investigation.

More vehicles arrived. State police investigators, additional medical personnel, a mobile command unit. The small diner parking lot filled with official presence. Officers established security perimeter, keeping civilians back, though no civilians were around for miles.

Sheriff Martinez stood in the center of the diner, radio crackling with constant updates. "FBI en route, ETA four hours. State police sending investigators. Medical examiner is documenting the freezer. Ground-penetrating team requested for suspected mass grave behind the structure. This is now a federal crime scene, multi-agency response."

Victor felt the weight lifting. Authority was here. Competent, organized authority that knew how to process horror into paperwork and evidence. His job was done. He'd driven his truck onto Route 66 looking for a shortcut. He'd found a nightmare. But he'd also found four other people willing to fight, and together they'd survived what thirty-seven others hadn't.

Behind him, officers were securing the walk-in freezer as primary crime scene. Plastic sheeting went up. Evidence markers placed beside each body. Photographers captured everything from multiple angles. The medical examiner moved between victims, initial assessments, taking notes. This would be months of work—identification, autopsy, analysis. But the process had begun.

An FBI agent would question them for hours when they arrived. Forensics would analyze everything. The bodies would be identified, families notified across twelve states. Earl and Dotty would be processed, fingerprinted, photographed, studied by people trying to understand what they were.

And maybe someone would figure out what they actually were. Maybe scientists would explain the impossible. Or maybe it would remain unexplained, filed under anomaly, classified and forgotten.

But thirty-seven victims would go home. Families would get closure. And Earl and Dotty would never kill again.

That was enough.

Sheriff Martinez approached Victor. "I need your statement. Everything, from the beginning."

"It's a long story," Victor said.

"I've got time."

Victor began. The breakdown on Route 66. The gleaming diner that shouldn't exist. The impossibly friendly owners. Meeting the others. Finding the freezer. The fight. Dawn. Restraint. Everything.

Martinez listened, face unreadable. Other officers took notes, recorded audio, documented every word.

When Victor finished, Martinez was quiet for a long moment. "That's the most insane story I've ever heard."

"I know."

"But those bodies are real. This scene is real. Your injuries are real."

"Everything's real. The impossible parts and the physical parts both."

"How do I write a report that says suspects died in 1955 but committed murders in 1982?"

"Honestly? I don't know. Maybe you just report what you can prove and leave the rest as unexplained."

Martinez looked at Earl and Dotty, still restrained, still watching with ancient eyes. "We're going to fingerprint you. Photograph you. Process you like any suspects. Then we'll figure out what you are."

"You'll never figure out what we are," Earl said. "But you can certainly try. It'll be entertaining."

Deputies moved to remove Earl and Dotty from the booth fixtures, preparing to transport them to the county jail. They approached carefully, weapons drawn, treating them as dangerous despite restraints.

Earl didn't resist. Dotty didn't fight. They allowed themselves to be moved, loaded into separate cruisers, secured behind cage screens. Still smiling. Still certain of something Victor couldn't understand.

As the cruisers pulled away, Victor watched them go. Thirty years of killing, ended in one night. Brought down by five people who refused to be victims.

The sun was high now—mid-morning, desert heat building. The nightmare felt distant in daylight, like it had happened in another world. But the evidence remained. Bodies, graves, injuries, impossible fingerprints.

Grace approached, her arm in a sling. "They're taking us to the hospital. All of us. For treatment and observation."

"Good," Victor said. His shoulder was starting to hurt properly now, adrenaline fading. "We need it."

"Then FBI wants statements. Detailed, recorded. We'll be here for days."

"I figured."

They stood together, looking at the diner. Crime scene tape was going up. Photographers were documenting everything. The Desert Diner was officially a crime scene, the worst New Mexico had seen in decades.

"We survived," Grace said quietly.

"We did."

"Against impossible odds."

"Yeah."

"Do you think it's over? Really over?"

Victor thought about Earl's smile, Dotty's certainty. The diner still standing, dormant but not destroyed. The thin place, the wound in the world, still existing.

"For now," he said. "It's over for now."

And that, for the moment, was enough.
