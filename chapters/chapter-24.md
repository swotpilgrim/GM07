# Chapter 24: Restraining the Dead

Victor had been awake for thirty-six hours straight. His shoulder throbbed where Earl had torn into it, his ribs ached where he'd been kicked, and every muscle in his body screamed exhaustion. But sunrise was breaking, and Earl and Dotty were weakening.

He could see it. The way Earl's movements became less coordinated as golden light poured through the broken windows. The way Dotty's supernatural speed faltered, her knife strikes becoming slower, more human. The diner's oppressive atmosphere was lifting like morning fog burning off.

"Now!" Victor shouted. "While they're weak! Now!"

Ricky was already moving, fresh electrical wire in hand. Together they descended on Earl—still burning from Denise's flare shot, still thrashing but flagging. Victor got his weight on Earl's shoulders, forcing him down against the booth fixture.

"Wire his arms!" Victor grunted. Ricky wrapped Earl's wrists, triple-layered the binding, secured it to the bolted metal frame. Earl pulled hard. The booth creaked but held.

Grace and Dale had Dotty cornered. She was still burning too, fire eating up her leg from Denise's perfect shot. Dale held her down despite his slashed arm, despite blood loss, despite everything. Grace wrapped wire around Dotty's limbs with shaking hands.

"Tighter," Dale said through gritted teeth. "She's still strong. Tighter."

Grace pulled the wire until it cut into dead flesh. Black ichor seeped out, not blood. Dotty hissed but couldn't break free.

Sunlight was flooding the diner now—full dawn, the eastern sky brilliant gold. The supernatural cold was gone, replaced by the natural desert heat. The lights stopped their pulsing heartbeat rhythm and settled into normal fluorescent buzz. The jukebox was silent, finally quiet after hours of distorted music.

The photographs on the wall were still. Just photos again, not reaching hands or watching eyes. Sixty years of victims returned to being images on yellowing paper.

"Is it over?" Grace asked. She was crying again, tears of relief mixed with exhaustion. "Is it actually over?"

Victor tested Earl's restraints. The wire held. The booth fixture was bolted solidly to the floor—he'd checked when they first prepared, made sure it could handle stress. Earl pulled again, weaker this time. The fire in his chest had burned down to ash. What remained looked like a museum display of a corpse—preserved, ancient, wrong.

"He's secured," Victor confirmed. "Not going anywhere."

Dale finished binding Dotty, securing her to another booth fixture ten feet from Earl. Both restrained, both weakened by sunlight and fire. Both staring at the group with expressions that had moved beyond human emotion into something Victor couldn't read.

"We did it," Ricky said. He sounded disbelieving. "Holy shit, we actually did it."

"Don't celebrate yet," Dale warned. He was pale from blood loss, swaying on his feet. "Dawn weakens them, but the diner itself—"

"Is just a building," Victor interrupted. He gestured around them. "Look. Fluorescent lights. Linoleum floor. Chrome fixtures. It's a diner. Normal physics. No more supernatural bullshit. Dawn broke whatever held this place outside normal time."

As if to confirm, Victor's watch started ticking normally. He checked—6:47 AM, August 15th, 1982. Time flowing forward at correct speed. The second hand moving clockwise, no more reversals or stops.

"The loop is broken," Dale said quietly. "For now."

Victor didn't want to think about "for now." He wanted to think about the fact that they'd survived. Five people had walked into a supernatural trap and fought their way out. That had to count for something.

His shoulder needed stitches. Dale's arm needed serious medical attention. Grace's limp needed checking—possible fracture. Ricky had bruises and exhaustion. But they were alive, and Earl and Dotty were restrained.

"Denise called the police," Grace said. She was looking toward the door, which stood open. Desert morning visible beyond, normal and beautiful. "How long until they arrive?"

"She said two hours," Victor replied. He checked his watch again—6:48 now. "Call was around six-thirty. So maybe ninety minutes?"

"Can we hold for ninety minutes?" Ricky asked. He was watching Earl and Dotty warily, crowbar still in hand.

Victor assessed their prisoners. Earl was secured with three layers of wire around wrists, ankles, and torso. Bolted to a fixture rated for two hundred pounds of force. Weakened by dawn, damaged by fire. Dotty similarly restrained, similarly weakened.

"We can hold," Victor decided. "They're physical. Supernatural, yeah, but physical. The restraints will work."

Earl laughed—a dry, papery sound. "You think dawn saves you? You think wire stops us? This place brought us back in 1955. It'll bring us back again."

"Maybe," Victor said. "But not today. Today you're restrained and authorities are coming. Let them deal with whatever the hell you are."

"They'll never believe you," Dotty said. Her voice had lost its multiple harmonics, sounding almost human again. "You'll tell them we died in 1955. They'll check records, find death certificates, and think you're insane."

"Grace photographed everything," Victor said. "Freezer, graves, your faces matching old photos. Evidence speaks louder than stories."

"Evidence is just data," Earl said. "Data requires interpretation. And people interpret impossible things as hoaxes, delusions, conspiracies. Not truth."

Dale sat heavily in a booth, pressing his wounded arm. "He's not wrong. This case will be classified unexplained. Files marked inconclusive. The bodies will be returned to families, but Earl and Dotty's nature..." He trailed off.

"Don't care," Victor said flatly. "My job was survive and stop them from killing more people. Both accomplished. Let bureaucrats handle the metaphysics."

He moved to the door, looked outside. Denise sat by the payphone, face to the sun. She looked smaller than she had inside—fragile, traumatized, but alive. Free, for the first time in thirty years.

The desert stretched endlessly. Route 66 ran east-west, cracked asphalt disappearing into heat shimmer. No traffic visible. But somewhere out there, authorities were responding. Help was coming.

Victor's trucker instincts catalogued the scene: diner battered but intact, vehicles in the lot (his Peterbilt, Grace's sedan, Dale's tow truck), survivors mobile, threats neutralized. Situation stable.

Not victorious—Earl and Dotty were restrained but not destroyed, the diner was dormant but not dead, questions remained unanswered. But stable. They'd bought time. Created an opening.

"We need to treat wounds," Grace said. She'd found the diner's first aid kit, was sorting through supplies. "Dale first—that arm is still bleeding. Then Victor's shoulder. Then everyone else."

Ricky maintained security, watching their prisoners while Grace worked. Victor sat still while she cleaned and bandaged his shoulder—the cut wasn't as deep as it felt, more bruising than tearing. Dale's forearm was worse, requiring pressure bandaging and elevation.

"You need stitches," Grace told Dale. "Real stitches, from real doctors."

"Ninety minutes," Dale said. "I can hold ninety minutes."

The sun climbed higher. The desert heated up. Inside the diner, temperature normalized—too warm without the AC running right, but normal. No more freezing cold. No more supernatural fluctuations.

Earl and Dotty sat in their restraints, watching. Sometimes they tested the wire, pulling experimentally. The fixtures held. Sometimes they spoke—to each other, to themselves, predictions about what would happen next. Mostly they just watched with eyes that had seen too much, lived too long, killed too many times.

"What happens to them?" Grace asked quietly. She was sitting beside Victor now, both of them keeping vigil. "I mean after police arrive. After they're processed. What do you do with people who are legally dead but physically present?"

Victor had no answer. In his world, problems had mechanical solutions. Engine breaks, you fix it. Tire blows, you replace it. Load needs delivering, you drive. But Earl and Dotty weren't a mechanical problem. They were philosophical, metaphysical, legal nightmares.

"Not our problem," he said finally. "We stopped them. That's enough."

"Is it?" Grace asked. "If the diner brought them back once, will it do it again? If this place is a thin place, a wound in the world like Dale says, does restraining its servants actually solve anything?"

"Grace," Victor said. "We survived. That's the win. Don't overthink it."

But she was right to ask. Victory wasn't total. They'd won a battle, not a war. The diner still stood. The neon sign was off now but intact—that red "EAT" that had blazed through the night. The walk-in freezer still contained bodies. The mass grave still waited behind the building.

Earl and Dotty were physical presences, restrained and weakened. But the place itself—the thin place, the wound, whatever metaphysical reality existed here—that remained. Dormant maybe. Weakened possibly. But not destroyed.

Ricky voiced what Victor was thinking: "We should burn it down. The whole thing. Make sure it can't come back."

"No," Dale said immediately. "Fire brought them back last time. Fire might make it worse. We leave it to authorities. Let them decide."

"Authorities will study it," Grace said. "Federal agencies, scientists, bureaucrats. They'll turn this into a research site, classified and controlled. The diner will exist indefinitely, preserved as anomaly."

"Better than killing more travelers," Victor said.

"Until it finds a way to start again," Earl said from his restraints. His voice was conversational, almost friendly. "Places like this are patient. Decades mean nothing. Centuries mean nothing. You've bought time. Maybe years. But eventually, travelers will stop here again. Eventually, someone will disappear. And the routine continues."

"Not if we warn people," Grace said. "Not if we document everything, publish it, make this location known as dangerous."

"You'll be dismissed as conspiracy theorists," Dotty said. "Cult survivors spinning elaborate delusions. The truth is too impossible. People protect themselves from impossible truths with rationalization."

Victor stood, walked to Earl and Dotty. Looked them in their too-old eyes. "Maybe. But today, right now, you're restrained. You're stopped. However long that lasts, it's something. Thirty-seven victims got justice. Denise got freedom. We survived. That counts."

"For now," Earl and Dotty said in unison. The synchronization was still there, still creepy. Still evidence they were extensions of something larger than themselves.

Victor returned to the window. Checked his watch—7:15. Forty-five minutes until estimated police arrival. The eastern horizon was brilliant with morning light. The desert had never looked so beautiful.

They'd held the line. Survived until dawn. Restrained the dead and waited for the living to arrive with help.

It wasn't total victory. But it was enough.

Behind him, Earl and Dotty watched with patient, ancient eyes. The diner settled into silent waiting. And outside, Denise stood in sunlight for the first time in thirty years, finally free.

Enough.
