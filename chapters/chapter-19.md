# Chapter 19: Confronting the Impossible

Victor needed something to do with his hands. The sedative made him want to pace, to move, to fight the drowsiness creeping through his system. Instead, he gripped the edge of the table and stared at the problem in front of him: how do you fight something that's already dead?

"Doesn't matter what they are," he said, forcing certainty into his voice. "Dead, alive, ghosts—whatever. They're physical. They bleed. They can be stopped."

Ricky nodded immediate agreement, but Grace looked uncertain. Dale remained quiet, watching with those dark eyes that seemed to see more than Victor wanted to think about.

"It's not that simple," Grace said. She'd closed her notebook, her documentation complete for the moment. "Think about the legal justification. If we hurt them—if we kill them—and they turn out to be... I don't know, somehow alive despite being dead, we're looking at assault charges. Maybe murder charges."

"Self-defense," Ricky said flatly. "They've killed thirty-seven people. They're planning to kill us. Any court in the country accepts self-defense."

"Against ghosts?" Grace pushed her glasses up. "How do we prove self-defense against entities that officially died in 1955? Their death certificates exist. We saw them. They're legally dead already. You can't murder someone who's already been declared dead for twenty-seven years."

Victor felt his jaw clench. "So we just let them kill us? Because the paperwork's complicated?"

"I'm not saying that." Grace's voice rose. "I'm saying we need to think this through. There are legal implications—"

"We'll be dead," Ricky interrupted. "Legal implications don't matter if we're in that freezer with the others."

Dale finally spoke. "The law is the least of our problems. Violence against them might make things worse."

Everyone turned. Dale sat with his hands flat on the table, expression grave.

"What do you mean worse?" Victor demanded.

"This place feeds on death and struggle. You've seen that in the pattern—traffic declined, they killed more, the loop strengthened. Violence against Earl and Dotty might feed the diner itself. Make it more powerful, not less."

"That's insane," Victor said. But even as he said it, he remembered the photo wall, the frozen bodies, the impossible preservation. Insane was already established. They'd crossed that boundary the moment they forced open the freezer.

"Is it?" Dale asked. "Everything here defies normal physics. Time doesn't flow right. People who should be dead walk around. Denise hasn't aged in thirty years. Why wouldn't violence feed supernatural entities?"

Grace leaned forward. "You're saying if we fight them, we make them stronger?"

"I'm saying it's possible. Indigenous traditions warn about certain places where violence only breeds more violence. Thin places can trap that energy, use it to sustain themselves."

Denise had been quiet through this debate, but now she spoke from her position near the wall. "The bikers."

Everyone looked at her.

"1967," she said quietly. "Five bikers stopped here. Mean guys, looking for trouble. They tried to rob the diner, held Earl at gunpoint, threatened Dotty. Demanded the cash register and anything valuable."

Victor felt cold despite the morning heat seeping through the windows. "What happened?"

"Earl and Dotty killed all five. Fast, efficient. Not like their usual routine—this was defense, immediate response. I watched from the kitchen. The bikers never had a chance. Earl moved faster than human, Dotty had knives in places knives shouldn't be. It was over in maybe three minutes. Five men dead."

"Jesus," Ricky breathed.

"But that's not the worst part." Denise's hands twisted her towel. "After they died, the diner... changed. Started glowing. The neon got brighter, the lights pulsed. I could hear humming, like the building itself was alive and satisfied. Earl and Dotty stood in the middle of five bodies and they looked younger. Stronger. The violence fed them. Fed the place."

The booth was silent. Outside, a hawk screamed somewhere in the empty desert.

"Five bodies are in the freezer," Grace said slowly. "Dated October 1967. We saw them."

"They're still there," Denise confirmed. "Never buried with the others. Kept frozen, like the diner wanted to preserve that moment. That feeding."

Victor's pragmatic mind rebelled against the implications. "So you're saying we can't fight back? Just accept death?"

"I'm saying violence might not save you," Denise replied. "Might just make you part of what feeds this place."

Ricky stood abruptly, chair scraping linoleum. "Unacceptable. Passivity is death. Action at least gives us a chance."

"What if action makes them unstoppable?" Grace asked.

"They're already unstoppable!" Ricky's voice cracked with frustration. "They've been killing for thirty years. They died in 1955 and they're still here. How much more unstoppable can they get?"

Dale's quiet voice cut through the tension. "There are different kinds of impossible. Right now, they're confined to this location, limited by certain rules. Violence might break those limits. Make them into something worse."

Victor forced himself to think through the sedative fog. Twelve years of trucking had taught him systematic problem-solving: identify the issue, list solutions, pick the best bad option. This was just another problem. A deeply wrong, supernatural problem, but still solvable.

"Okay," he said. "Let's map this out. Option one: we fight them directly. Risk: might feed the loop, make them stronger. Benefit: we might win through overwhelming force. Five against two, even with supernatural strength."

"Option two," Grace added. "We restrain them without killing. Subdue, bind, wait for authorities. Lower violence might not trigger the feeding effect."

"Option three," Ricky said. "We run. Fix the vehicles, leave before they can kill us. Let someone else deal with this."

"Can't run," Denise said. "Vehicles are sabotaged beyond field repair. Nearest town is fifty miles. Desert will kill you before you make ten miles on foot."

"Option four." Dale's voice was measured. "We do nothing. Let the routine complete. Accept what happens."

"That's not an option," Victor said immediately.

"It's always an option," Dale replied. "Just usually the worst one."

Grace pulled her notebook back out, started writing. Victor recognized the academic response to stress: document everything, create structure out of chaos. "The core question is: can they be stopped? Permanently, I mean. Or are we just fighting symptoms while the diner itself continues?"

"The diner's the real threat," Dale said. "Earl and Dotty are tools. Extensions. You saw how they move together, synchronized. They're not fully autonomous anymore. Whatever brought them back in 1955 is the actual entity we're facing."

"Then how do we fight a building?" Ricky demanded.

"You don't. You escape it. Or you break the rules that sustain it. Or you outlast it."

Victor's head ached. The sedative was making everything harder—thoughts came slower, connections took longer. He needed clarity and couldn't quite grasp it. "What rules sustain it?"

Dale considered. "Blood sacrifice. Death feeding the boundary. If Earl and Dotty can't kill, the diner might weaken. That's the theory, anyway. Thin places require certain conditions to maintain stability."

"So restraint is the key," Grace said. "We stop them from killing without feeding the violence loop. Bind them, make killing impossible, starve the diner."

"And if they break free?" Ricky asked.

"Then we've failed and we're dead," Victor said bluntly. "But at least we tried something other than accepting death."

Denise moved closer to the booth. "There's something else you need to know. Earl and Dotty—they're not entirely themselves anymore. I've watched them for three decades. Each kill makes them less human, more... other. In 1952, when I first arrived, they had personalities. Earl told jokes, Dotty sang while cooking. Now they're more like machinery. Going through motions, operating on routine. Whatever they were died with them in 1955. What's left is just function."

"Sympathetic backstory doesn't change what they've done," Ricky said.

"I'm not asking for sympathy," Denise replied. "I'm telling you what you're facing. They're not human anymore. They're not even fully ghost. They're something in between, and that in-between is dangerous in ways regular people or regular spirits aren't."

Victor absorbed this, adding it to his mental calculations. Not human, not ghost, something hybrid. Physically vulnerable but supernaturally sustained. Weakened by sunlight, strengthened by violence, trapped in routine but aware enough to plan.

"We have advantages," he said, thinking out loud. "Numbers. Knowledge. We understand their routine. We're aware of the sedative. It's mid-morning, they're slightly weaker in daylight. And we have Denise—she knows their patterns, can predict their moves."

"We also have disadvantages," Grace countered. "We're drugged. Exhausted. Trapped in their domain. And if violence makes things worse, our instinct to fight might doom us."

"So we compromise," Victor said. "We prepare for confrontation but aim for restraint. Arm ourselves with non-lethal options. Wire to bind, tools to control, numbers to overwhelm. We hurt them only as much as necessary to stop them. Minimum violence for maximum effect."

Ricky looked skeptical. "Combat doesn't work that way. Minimum violence gets you killed."

"Maximum violence might get us worse than killed," Dale said. "Might get us trapped here like Denise. Or turned into extensions of the diner ourselves."

The weight of that settled over the booth. Victor looked at Denise—thirty years old but appearing twenty-four, frozen in the moment of her entrapment. Thirty years of witnessing horror, unable to age or leave or die. If that was an alternative to death, maybe death was preferable.

"Vote," he said abruptly. "Fight or flight? Knowing flight probably means desert death, and fight might feed the diner."

"Fight," Ricky said immediately.

"Fight," Grace said after a pause. "But carefully. Minimum necessary violence."

"Fight," Dale agreed. "But with awareness. This place has rules. We need to respect them even as we break them."

All eyes turned to Denise. She looked at each of them in turn, decades of fear and hope warring in her expression. "Fight," she whispered. "Because I can't take thirty more years of watching."

Victor nodded. "Fight it is. We prepare restraints, arm ourselves with tools, stay together. When Earl and Dotty make their move—probably within two hours when the sedative peaks—we counter-attack. We bind them, hold them until authorities arrive. We break their routine without feeding the diner's hunger for violence."

"And if it doesn't work?" Grace asked.

"Then at least we tried," Victor said. "At least we fought instead of becoming another photo on that wall."

Outside, the desert stretched endlessly under climbing sun. Somewhere in that expanse, Interstate 40 carried normal traffic through normal space. But here, in this pocket of impossible, they were trapped in rules older than highways or diners or America itself.

They had two hours to prepare. Two hours before the sedative peaked and Earl and Dotty struck. Two hours to turn victims into fighters.

The routine had never been broken. But every pattern could be interrupted. Every cycle could end.

They just had to survive the attempt.
