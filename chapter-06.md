# Chapter 6: Footprints in Sand

The second night was worse than the first.

Ricky sat outside the diner at 2 AM, back against the cinderblock garage wall, smoking and watching. The desert night was cold enough to see his breath between cigarette drags. Above, stars burned with alien brightness—no light pollution this far from anywhere, just the red neon "EAT" sign pulsing against the black.

Inside, the phantom customers had started arriving again. Same pattern as before: appear from darkness, order food, eat mechanically, pay exact change, vanish. Grace was documenting them, writing frantic notes. Victor watched with increasing tension. Dale sat in resigned silence.

Ricky had needed air. Needed distance from Earl and Dotty's synchronized movements, from Denise's terrified smiles, from the wrongness that permeated every inch of the diner's interior.

Out here, the desert felt more honest. Cold and dark and potentially lethal, but honest about it. No pretense of hospitality masking predation.

The door jingled.

Ricky's head turned. A customer was leaving—middle-aged man in a trucker's jacket, weathered face, eyes distant and glassy like all the phantoms. He walked past where Ricky sat without acknowledging his presence.

Stepped off the gravel lot into the sand and scrub.

Kept walking.

Ricky watched, curious. Where was the guy going? There was nothing out there. No vehicles, no roads, no structures. Just miles of desert in every direction.

The man didn't hesitate. Didn't look around, didn't slow. Just walked in a perfectly straight line into the darkness, quickly swallowed by the night.

Ricky ground out his cigarette. Combat instincts said don't follow, unknown terrain is death. But tracker instincts said this was intel worth gathering.

He stood, pulled his jacket tight against the cold, followed.

The man was visible maybe forty feet ahead—just a silhouette against starlight. Ricky maintained distance, moved quietly. Old jungle skills: step on rocks not sand, control your breathing, watch peripheral vision.

The man's gait never varied. Steady, mechanical, unnaturally perfect. No stumbling on rocks, no dodging creosote bushes. Just walking.

Ricky counted paces. Eighty. A hundred. Hundred-fifty. They were maybe a quarter-mile from the diner now, the neon sign a red glow behind them.

The man kept walking.

Ricky's breath fogged in the cold. He could hear his own heartbeat, the crunch of sand under his boots, the distant whistle of wind through the mesas.

No sound from the man ahead. No breathing, no footsteps. Just silent forward motion.

Two hundred paces.

Then the man stopped.

Just froze mid-stride. Stood completely still.

Ricky stopped too, every combat instinct screaming. He dropped to a crouch behind a boulder, watching.

The man stood motionless for thirty seconds. Perfectly still. Not shifting weight, not breathing that Ricky could see.

Then he simply wasn't there anymore.

Not walked away—vanished. One second a silhouette against stars, the next second empty desert.

Ricky stayed crouched, counting to sixty. Waiting for movement, ambush, explanation.

Nothing.

He approached the spot where the man had been, moving carefully. The ground was sand and scattered rock, relatively flat. Starlight was bright enough to see clearly.

He examined the area in expanding circles. No footprints. No disturbance. No evidence anyone had been there.

Ricky pulled out his Zippo, flicked it, crouched low. The flickering flame revealed sand patterns—wind-rippled, undisturbed. No boot prints, no body depressions, nothing.

But he'd seen the man. Watched him walk here, watched him stop, watched him vanish.

He searched for twenty minutes, expanding his radius. Used tracker skills learned in jungle and refined in desert—reading ground, looking for bent grass, scuff marks, any sign of passage.

Nothing. The desert showed no trace.

Except his own tracks. Clear as day—his boot prints leading from the diner, circling, searching.

Only his.

Ricky stood in the cold darkness, lighter flame guttering. Either he was losing his mind, or something impossible had just happened.

He'd seen enough impossible things in Vietnam to know which option was more likely.

He walked back to the diner, hands shoved in his jacket pockets, jaw tight.

Inside, the phantom customers continued their routine. Earl and Dotty served with cheerful efficiency. Grace looked up when Ricky entered, saw his expression.

"What happened?"

"Followed one of them. Into the desert." Ricky lit a fresh cigarette. "He disappeared. No footprints."

Victor frowned. "What do you mean disappeared?"

"I mean I watched him walk maybe a quarter-mile out, then he just stopped existing. And he left no tracks in the sand."

"You probably just lost him in the dark," Victor said. But his voice was uncertain.

"No." Ricky met his eyes. "I'm a tracker. Did two tours tracking VC through triple-canopy jungle. I don't lose people. And I know what tracks look like." He drew on his cigarette. "He left none. Only mine."

Dale was listening, face grave. Grace had her notebook out.

"Show us," Grace said. "At dawn. Show us the area."

Ricky nodded.

The next three hours crawled. More phantom customers came and went. Earl and Dotty's synchronization never wavered. Denise moved through her routine with mechanical terror.

And Ricky sat at his booth, smoking, watching the darkness beyond the windows, waiting for dawn.

When gray light finally started bleeding into the eastern sky, he stood.

"Now."

Victor and Dale followed him outside. The pre-dawn desert was harsh and beautiful—the air cold, the light flat and unforgiving. The diner looked smaller in approaching daylight, less imposing.

Ricky led them into the scrubland, retracing his path. His boot prints from hours earlier were clear in the sand—approaching, circling, searching, returning.

"There," Ricky said, pointing. "That's where he stopped. Where he vanished."

They examined the ground. Ricky's tracks were obvious—deep tread patterns from his combat boots, evenly spaced, clear direction of travel. They showed his approach to this spot, his searching pattern around it, his return path.

No other tracks.

Victor crouched, running his hand over the sand. "Wind could have covered them."

"In three hours?" Ricky shook his head. "Look at my tracks. Still perfect. No wind damage. And look—" He pointed to a creosote bush ten feet away. "No bent branches where he would've passed. No scuff marks on rocks. Nothing."

Dale knelt, touched the ground. Closed his eyes.

"My grandfather called this La Casa de Los Perdidos," he said quietly. "The House of the Lost Ones. Said there are places in the desert where the world is thin. Where the boundary between what is and what was gets confused. People slip through. Or things slip through into our world."

"That's superstition," Victor said. But he was staring at the tracks—Ricky's tracks, only Ricky's—with an expression of deep unease.

"Is it?" Dale straightened. "You saw Earl and Dotty's death certificates. You saw them unchanged in photos across thirty years. You've watched customers appear with no vehicles and vanish from memory." He gestured at the sand. "At what point does documented evidence overrule your skepticism?"

Victor was quiet.

Ricky lit another cigarette, studying the pattern of his own footprints in the sand. The physical evidence of his search. Proof he'd been here, that he'd followed someone.

Someone who left no trace.

"In Vietnam," Ricky said, "I saw things. Villages that were there at dusk and gone by dawn. Enemy soldiers who took bullets and kept fighting. Firefights in the jungle where we found no bodies after, no blood, no shell casings. Just us, exhausted and terrified, surrounded by normal jungle."

"Combat stress," Victor said automatically.

"Maybe. That's what the Army psychiatrists said." Ricky exhaled smoke. "But a lot of us saw the same things. Different units, different locations, all experiencing impossibilities. After a while, you accept that reality has cracks in it. Rules that don't apply everywhere."

Grace had appeared, camera in hand. She photographed the ground—Ricky's solitary tracks, the absence of any others.

"How far did you follow him?" she asked.

"Quarter-mile, roughly. Two hundred paces."

She walked the distance, photographing at intervals. Ricky's boot prints showed clearly. No other disturbance in the sand.

When she returned, her expression was troubled.

"The diner's out there. Earl and Dotty are out there. Serving customers who don't exist." She lowered her camera. "What if this whole area is a thin place? What if geography works differently here?"

"Then we're trapped in it," Victor said flatly.

Dale nodded. "My grandfather warned people to stay away. Said once you stop at certain places, leaving gets complicated. The place claims you."

The sun broke over the eastern mesas, flooding the desert with gold light. The diner behind them blazed chrome in the dawn. Impossibly perfect, impossibly preserved.

And all around them, the desert stretched—beautiful and hostile and operating under rules they didn't understand.

"We need to verify our vehicles are still sabotaged," Victor said. "Then we need a plan."

They walked back toward the diner in silence. Ricky brought up the rear, looking back once at the spot where the phantom trucker had vanished.

No footprints but his own.

Evidence of impossibility.

He'd spent five years trying to convince himself that what he'd seen in Vietnam wasn't real. That combat stress had fractured his perception, that the impossible things were trauma responses, that reality didn't actually break.

But here it was again. Evidence that the world had thin spots, places where rules bent or dissolved entirely. Places that consumed people and erased them from memory.

And he was trapped in one.

The diner's bells jingled as they entered. Earl was cooking breakfast—bacon and eggs, the smell rich and enticing. Dotty poured coffee with her perpetual smile.

"Morning, boys!" Earl called cheerfully. "Sleep well?"

Ricky met Denise's eyes across the diner. She was setting tables, moving through her terror-routine. And in her expression, he saw confirmation:

This place took people. Made them vanish. And whether through death or supernatural abduction or some combination of both, once you were gone, you left no trace.

No footprints.

No evidence you'd ever existed at all.

Ricky sat in his booth, accepted coffee from Denise's shaking hands, and started counting exits.

Not many. And none of them led anywhere except more desert.

He'd survived two tours in hell. He'd live through this too.

But for the first time since coming home, he wasn't certain.
