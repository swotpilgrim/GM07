# Chapter 5: Research and Records

Morning brought no relief.

Grace had hoped daylight would make the diner feel normal again, would reveal rational explanations for the night's strangeness. Instead, the August sun just made everything harshly visible—the too-perfect chrome, the impossibly preserved vinyl, Earl and Dotty moving through their synchronized routine after working sixteen hours straight without fatigue.

She needed air. Space. Distance.

"I'm going to drive to the county seat," she announced at breakfast. Earl had made eggs and bacon, had served them with that same too-wide smile. "For my research. I want to document this diner's history properly."

That was partially true. Her dissertation did need historical context. But mostly, she needed to check something. Something the academic part of her brain insisted had a rational explanation, even as evidence piled up against rationality.

"That'd be about fifty miles east," Dale said quietly. He was nursing coffee, hadn't touched his eggs. "Carlsbad. County clerk's office should have records."

"I'll be back in a few hours," Grace said, gathering her camera and notebooks.

Earl beamed. "You be careful on that highway, hon. Lots of curves."

The drive should have been relaxing. Her VW van was old but reliable, the desert morning beautiful—scrubland stretching to distant mesas.

But Grace's hands gripped the wheel too tight, kept checking the rearview mirror. The diner remained visible for miles, chrome glinting.

Then a curve, and it was gone.

She exhaled. Hadn't realized she'd been holding her breath.

Carlsbad was a small town baking under late-morning heat. The county building was a low stucco structure with a parking lot mostly empty. Grace locked the van, gathered her camera, entered air-conditioned quiet.

The clerk was a woman in her fifties, reading glasses on a chain, name tag reading "Barbara."

"Help you?"

"I'm researching Route 66 businesses for my dissertation," Grace said, showing her university ID. "Specifically the Desert Diner, about fifty miles west. Historical records—business licenses, property deeds?"

Barbara's expression shifted. Something guarded. "The diner."

"You know it?"

"Everyone around here knows it." Barbara removed her glasses, polished them. "What exactly are you looking for?"

"Everything. Opening date, owners, business history."

Barbara was quiet. Then: "Let me get the archived newspapers. You can use the microfiche reader."

She returned with boxes of film reels, decades of local paper. Grace threaded the first reel—1940s editions—and started searching.

Found it immediately.

November 1948: Grand Opening of Earl's Diner. Photo showed the chrome building fresh and new, Earl and Dotty young and smiling, cutting a ribbon. The article gushed about Route 66 tourism, post-war prosperity, American dreams made real.

Grace photographed the screen with her Pentax, moved forward in time.

1950s editions showed the diner thriving. Multiple mentions—best burger in the county, popular stop for travelers, Earl and Dotty beloved local figures.

Then, August 1955.

Grace froze.

The headline filled the microfiche screen: "ROUTE 66 DINER FIRE CLAIMS TWO LIVES"

She read with hands shaking.

A grease fire had broken out in the early morning hours of August 17, 1955. Earl and Dotty Higgins perished in the blaze. The building was completely destroyed. Bodies recovered, identified through dental records and wedding rings. Tragic loss, the article said. Beloved couple, the community mourned.

There was a photograph: the diner reduced to charred rubble and twisted metal.

Grace photographed it, advanced to the next day's edition.

Obituaries. Earl Higgins, age 42. Dotty Higgins, age 38. Funeral arrangements. Burial at Carlsbad Cemetery.

She photographed everything. The newspaper masthead showing the date. The articles. The photos of rubble. The obituaries with Earl and Dotty's names in black print.

"Finding what you need?" Barbara appeared at her shoulder.

"The diner burned down in 1955," Grace said carefully. "Earl and Dotty died."

"That's right."

"But the diner's there now. And they're there. I met them yesterday."

Barbara's expression became even more guarded. "Lots of Higgins around these parts. Family must've rebuilt, used the same names."

"The same people," Grace insisted. "Same faces. I have photographs showing them from 1948 to 1981, unchanged."

"I'm sure it just seems that way."

But Barbara wouldn't meet her eyes. And her hand trembled slightly when she gathered the microfiche reels.

"Can I see death certificates?" Grace asked. "Property records, business licenses from after 1955?"

Barbara hesitated. Then, with visible reluctance, led Grace to filing cabinets.

The death certificates were there. Official, stamped, filed properly. Earl Higgins, died August 17, 1955, cause of death: smoke inhalation and burns. Dotty Higgins, same date, same cause. Both buried at Carlsbad Cemetery, plots 447 and 448.

Grace photocopied everything with Barbara watching in silence.

"The diner," Grace said. "Who owns it now? There must be property records."

Barbara pulled a file. Spread papers across the desk.

The property had been sold in 1956 to a development company. But the sale had never completed—company dissolved, property reverted to county ownership. In 1963, it was auctioned. No buyers. In 1971, marked for demolition. Never demolished—contractor reported building had vanished, paperwork lost.

The current status: abandoned property, county ownership, no structures listed.

"But it's there," Grace said. "It exists. People go there."

"People say lots of things about that stretch of highway." Barbara gathered the papers, returned them to the file. "Desert plays tricks. Heat mirages, you know. Folks see things."

"I ate there. I slept there last night. It's real."

Barbara met her eyes finally. "If you're smart, you'll finish your research and leave. Don't go back."

"Why?"

"Because some places aren't right. And that diner's one of them. Has been since before I was born. People go there, sometimes they don't leave. Sometimes they do leave and wish they hadn't." She paused. "My uncle stopped there in 1963. Said Earl and Dotty served him the best burger he'd ever had. Said they looked exactly like they did in the '48 photos. Said the whole place felt wrong."

"What happened to him?"

"Wouldn't go near that highway again. Had nightmares until he died." Barbara closed the file with finality. "You got what you needed for your research. I'd say that's enough."

Grace gathered her photocopies, her photographs, her evidence. Thanked Barbara quietly.

Drove back toward the diner in a daze.

The documents sat on the passenger seat. Death certificates dated August 17, 1955. Obituaries. Photos of the burned building. Official county records declaring the property abandoned, no structures present.

And in fifty miles, she'd arrive at a gleaming chrome diner where Earl and Dotty Higgins would be serving lunch, moving in perfect synchronization, exactly as they'd done for thirty-four years.

Except they'd been dead for twenty-seven of those years.

The van's engine hummed. Heat shimmered off asphalt. Grace's academic training warred with the evidence in her hands.

Impossible. Biologically, chronologically, legally impossible.

But real.

The diner came into view in the distance—chrome glinting, neon dormant, perfectly preserved.

Grace pulled into the parking lot. Victor's Peterbilt sat where he'd left it, Dale's tow truck nearby. She grabbed her documentation, walked inside.

The bells jingled. Earl looked up from the grill, smiled. "Back so soon, hon? Hope you got everything you needed."

Grace walked past him to where Victor, Ricky, and Dale sat in a booth.

She spread the photocopies across the table. Death certificates on top.

"Earl and Dotty Higgins," she said quietly. "Died in a fire, August 1955."

Victor picked up a death certificate, studied it. His jaw worked. "This has to be fake. Or they're using dead relatives' names as a hoax."

"Fingerprints are on file from their business license," Grace said. She was shaking. "We could compare them."

"No need." Dale's voice was flat. He stared at the documents without touching them. "It's real."

"You knew," Grace accused.

"I knew to stay away. My grandfather warned me. Said Earl and Dotty died when he was a young man but the diner never closed. Said they kept serving people like nothing had changed."

"That's impossible," Victor said, but his voice lacked conviction.

"Yeah," Dale agreed. "It is."

Ricky looked at the death certificates, then toward the counter where Earl cooked and Dotty served. His expression was calm, accepting. "War taught me impossible doesn't mean not real."

Victor shook his head, but Grace could see his rationality cracking. The evidence was there. Official documents. Dated photographs. Mathematical impossibility staring back from black-and-white photocopies.

Grace pulled out her camera photos of the wall—Earl and Dotty in 1948, 1962, 1974, 1981. Unchanging. Identical.

"I don't understand," Victor said quietly.

"Neither do I," Grace admitted. "But the documentation is solid. They died. They're buried. And they're here."

A sound made them all turn.

Denise stood ten feet away, holding a coffee pot. Tears streamed down her cheeks.

"You found it," she whispered. "You actually found proof."

"You knew?" Grace asked.

"I've known for thirty years." Denise's smile was gone. Just raw fear and exhausted hope remained. "I've tried to tell people. They never believe me. Never listen. But you have evidence."

"Thirty years?" Victor frowned. "You're what, twenty-five?"

"Twenty-four," Denise said. "Forever twenty-four. Since June 1952."

The implication hung in the air.

"Denise!" Earl's voice from the kitchen, cheerful and commanding. "We need more coffee up front, sweetie."

Denise flinched. Pasted her smile back on. "Coming!"

She moved away quickly, but not before Grace saw the desperation in her eyes.

Earl appeared at their booth. Saw the papers spread across the table. His smile never wavered.

"Finding interesting things, are we?"

Grace met his eyes. Up close, they were strange—too bright, too fixed. Like a doll's eyes.

"We found your death certificates," she said.

"Did you now?" Earl's tone remained cheerful. "Well, there's lots of Higgins around these parts. Family names get reused. People look like their grandparents. Happens all the time."

"Your fingerprints would prove it one way or the other," Ricky said flatly.

Earl's smile widened impossibly. "Well now, that's an interesting idea. But I've got lunch to cook. You folks enjoy your research."

He glided away, returning to Dotty's orbit, their synchronized dance resuming.

Grace, Victor, Ricky, and Dale sat in silence, staring at the evidence.

"We need to leave," Victor said. "Soon as we can get vehicles running."

"What if we can't leave?" Grace asked quietly. "What if that's not how this works?"

Ricky lit a cigarette. "Then we figure out what kind of trap we're in and how to break it."

Dale closed his eyes. "La Casa de Los Perdidos. The House of the Lost Ones. My grandfather wasn't speaking metaphorically."

Outside, the desert stretched in all directions—beautiful and empty and utterly indifferent to their fear.

And inside the diner, Earl and Dotty Higgins continued their eternal routine, serving food to the living and the dead, unchanged by twenty-seven years in their graves.

Grace gathered the death certificates carefully, filed them in her notebook.

Evidence. Documentation. Proof of the impossible.

It didn't help at all.
