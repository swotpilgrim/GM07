# Chapter 13: The Wall of Trophies

Ricky had seen trophy walls before.

In Vietnam, both sides took them. VC collected dog tags, insignia patches, Zippo lighters. Americans collected ears, sometimes. War crimes nobody talked about but everyone knew happened. Proof of kills, markers of survival, totems against death.

This was different. More organized. More disturbing.

The diner's photo wall stretched forty feet, floor to ceiling. Sixty years of frames, each showing an object. Sometimes vehicles—Mustangs, Chevys, pickup trucks gleaming in parking lot sun. Sometimes personal items—leather jackets draped over booth backs, wedding rings resting on counters, duffel bags abandoned by doors.

And in the background of every photo, barely visible but present if you knew to look: bodies. Sometimes in the freezer. Sometimes being dragged across gravel. Sometimes already buried, just disturbed sand visible at frame's edge.

Earl and Dotty hadn't been hiding evidence. They'd been documenting kills.

Ricky stood before the wall at midnight while the others tried to sleep. His combat mind catalogued details.

"You see it too." Dale appeared beside him, quiet as desert wind.

"See what?"

"The time wrongness."

Ricky had noticed but hadn't articulated it. Dale pointed to a photo dated 1956—scrawled on the frame's bottom in Earl's handwriting. The vehicle was a '54 Chevy, chrome gleaming. Normal enough.

Except in the background: newspapers visible through the diner window showing headlines from 1958.

"Two-year discrepancy," Dale said. "And here—" He indicated another frame. "1967 according to Earl's dating. But that's a 1972 Ford in the background, and the clothing styles are mid-seventies."

Ricky examined more photos with new awareness. The dating was wrong. Consistently, systematically wrong.

"They're not tracking real time," he said.

"Can't. They're dead, existing in 1955. Everything after is... approximation. Guess work. They label photos with dates they think match, but they're frozen in their death moment. Can't accurately perceive time flowing outside their loop."

Ricky moved along the wall. Each trophy photo showed temporal bleeding—anachronisms, inconsistencies, evidence that Earl and Dotty's perception of reality had deteriorated across decades.

A 1960 photo showing 1963 fashions.
A 1975 photo with newspapers from 1972.
A 1981 photo with a vehicle that wouldn't be manufactured until 1983.

"They're guessing," Ricky said. "Trying to maintain the illusion they're alive and aware, but time doesn't work right for them anymore."

"Denise said sometimes she lives the same day twice. Sometimes weeks blur. The thin place doesn't follow linear time."

Ricky had experienced time distortion in combat. Firefights that felt like hours but clocked at minutes. Nights on watch that stretched eternal. But that was adrenaline and fear. This was geography itself breaking causality's rules.

He examined specific trophies more carefully. The 1967 Mustang—he'd identified it earlier from Grace's cataloguing. Owner Peter Williams, UCLA student. The Mustang gleamed pristine in the photo.

But Ricky had seen that Mustang in the parking lot their first day. Covered in dust, tires flat, chrome pitted. Fifteen years of desert exposure.

"The photo shows it new," he said. "But the actual vehicle aged normally."

"Because the trophy is the photograph, not the object," Dale said. "The place keeps the memory, not the thing. That's why phantom customers appear—memories playing on loop, not actual people."

Ricky thought about the elderly trucker he'd followed into the desert. The man who'd vanished leaving no footprints. Memory given temporary form? Echo of a death from decades past?

Made as much sense as anything here.

He moved to recent photos—victims from the last few years. The dating was more accurate, margins of error smaller. But inconsistencies remained. A 1980 photo showing a cassette player model from 1982. A 1981 photo with newspapers dated wrong by three months.

"They're degrading," Ricky said. "Earl and Dotty. The longer they exist past death, the less they can track reality accurately. Eventually they'll lose all temporal anchoring."

"And then what?"

"Then they become pure automatons. Just the diner's function, no consciousness remaining. Cooking, serving, killing on total autopilot."

The thought was chilling. Not death but erasure. Personality dissolving into mechanical repetition until nothing remained but hunger and routine.

Ricky counted trophies. Thirty-seven matched Denise's victim list. But there were more frames. Older photos, faded beyond recognition. Forty? Fifty?

"How long has this place been killing?" he asked.

Dale studied the oldest photos. "Some of these look pre-1948. Before Earl and Dotty built the diner."

"Meaning the thin place was active before them."

"Always has been, probably. Desert's old. Older than highways, older than white settlement. My grandfather said this spot was avoided for centuries. Maybe Earl and Dotty aren't the first. Just the current... manifestation."

The implications were vast and terrifying. This wasn't about two serial killers. It was about a location that consumed people, that required death, that created killers to feed its hunger. Earl and Dotty were symptoms, not cause.

"Can we destroy it?" Ricky asked.

"The place? No. It's geography, reality structure. Can't destroy that with violence."

"Can we escape it?"

Dale was quiet. Then: "I don't know. Denise hasn't escaped in thirty years. But she's been claimed—part of the loop now. We're not. Yet. Maybe we can still leave."

"How?"

"Survive until dawn. Every dawn. Thin places are weakest in daylight—boundaries solidify slightly, supernatural recedes. If we can stay alive through nights, maybe we find a gap. A way out."

It was thin hope. But Ricky had survived two tours in hell on thinner.

He examined the trophy photos again, this time looking for patterns beyond chronology. Victims fell into categories:

Drifters and runaways: 40%
Travelers on unusual routes: 30%
Locals with secrets: 20%
Random selection: 10%

The 10% bothered him. Ten percent had no obvious vulnerability, no clear reason for targeting. Just wrong place, wrong time. Random predation.

"We might be in that ten percent now," he said. "After breaking into the freezer, we shifted from selective targets to immediate threats. Criteria don't matter anymore—just elimination."

"Which means we can't negotiate or prove we're not worth killing."

"Right. We're committed. Fight or die."

Ricky had fought before. Knew how. But those had been human enemies following human logic. This was different—fighting something already dead, something bound to place, something operating under rules he didn't understand.

He inventoried their tactical situation:

**Assets:**
- Five people, able-bodied
- Basic weapons: knives, crowbar, tire iron
- Knowledge of enemy patterns (thanks to Denise)
- Documentation of crimes (thanks to Grace)
- Indigenous understanding of thin places (thanks to Dale)
- Combat training (him)
- Vehicles skills (Victor)

**Liabilities:**
- Vehicles sabotaged, no escape
- No communication with outside
- No reinforcements coming
- Food and water limited
- Enemy controls territory
- Supernatural advantages unclear

**Enemy capabilities:**
- Supernatural endurance (work without rest)
- Enhanced speed and strength (Denise's testimony)
- Home field knowledge (sixty years experience)
- Control over diner structure (locks engage, lights flicker)
- Possible perception beyond normal human range
- Unknown limitations or vulnerabilities

The math wasn't good. But Ricky had survived worse odds.

Principle from combat: when outnumbered and outgunned, change the battlefield. Don't fight where the enemy is strongest.

"We can't fight them in the diner," he said. "It's their domain. We need them in the open desert, in daylight, away from their power base."

"How do we lure them out?"

"Fire, maybe. Threat to the building. Or we leave, force them to chase us."

"Denise can't leave."

"Then we send four out, one stays with Denise. Split their focus, divide their attention."

Dale considered. "Thin places work through attention and memory. Splitting up might weaken the place's hold."

Or it might get them killed separately instead of together. But doing nothing guaranteed death.

Ricky studied the trophy wall one more time. Sixty years of victims. Hundreds maybe, dating back before Earl and Dotty. All those people who'd stopped at this location, been consumed by it, reduced to photographs and echoes.

He wouldn't join them.

"Tomorrow we plan the attack," he said.

Dale looked at him. "Attack?"

"We're not waiting to be processed. We're taking the fight to them. Combat initiative—strike first, strike hard, exploit weaknesses. Might not kill them, but we can immobilize, restrain, eliminate them as threats."

"That's a military approach to a supernatural problem."

"Got a better idea?"

Dale didn't.

They stood before the wall of trophies as midnight deepened. Outside, phantom customers drifted through the parking lot. Inside, Earl and Dotty moved through their eternal choreography.

And somewhere in the thin place's twisted physics, time looped and broke and reformed wrong.

Ricky turned away from the wall.

Tomorrow, they'd fight back.

Because the alternative—becoming another photo, another trophy, another echo trapped forever—was unacceptable.

He'd survived Vietnam.

He'd survive this.

He had to.
