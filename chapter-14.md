# Chapter 14: Ricky's Combat Planning

Pre-dawn. The coldest hour.

Ricky gathered them in a loose circle behind Dale's tow truck—Victor, Grace, Dale, Denise. Five civilians about to become combatants.

"Tactical situation," he began. Military brevity. "We have hostile forces occupying superior position with home-field advantage. We're outmatched in direct confrontation. Standard approach fails. We need asymmetric warfare."

Victor rubbed sleep from his eyes. "Speak English."

"We can't beat them in their territory using their rules. We change the game."

Ricky had spent the night planning. Combat theory applied to impossible circumstances. Not ideal, but workable.

"Enemy assessment," he continued. "Earl and Dotty. Physical capabilities enhanced beyond human normal—speed, strength, endurance. But Denise confirms they can be hurt, restrained. They're not invulnerable."

"They're dead," Grace pointed out.

"They're physical. That's what matters. Physical can be fought."

He outlined enemy patterns based on Denise's thirty years of observation:

**Earl:**
- Primary aggressor
- Uses meat hook
- Targets spine for immobilization
- Fast but predictable
- Stronger than appearance suggests

**Dotty:**
- Secondary attacker
- Uses kitchen knives
- Finishing strikes
- Faster than Earl
- More adaptable

"Standard MO: drug victims first via food. Wait for sedative effect. Attack when vulnerable."

"We haven't eaten their food in two days," Victor said.

"Correct. Which means if they attack, it's without that advantage. We'll be alert, capable of fighting back."

Ricky pulled out Dale's tire iron, Victor's crowbar, kitchen knives from the diner. Laid them like an armory.

"Weapons inventory. Not much, but enough. Distribution: Victor takes crowbar—reach advantage, uses his strength. Dale takes tire iron—similar. I take primary knife. Grace, secondary knife. Denise, you're non-combatant—stay behind us, call out warnings."

"I can fight," Denise said quietly.

"You've been traumatized for thirty years. Combat effectiveness compromised. No shame—just tactical reality."

She didn't argue.

Ricky drew formations in the sand with a stick. "We fight as unit. Two-person teams. Victor-Dale, me-Grace. Denise center, protected. Earl approaches, Victor-Dale engage. Dotty approaches, Grace and I engage. We don't separate, don't pursue, maintain formation."

"What if they attack together?" Grace asked.

"Then we focus fire. All weapons on one target until immobilized, then switch to second. Serial engagement instead of parallel."

Victor studied the sand diagrams. "You're talking about killing them."

"I'm talking about stopping them. If that requires lethal force, yes."

"They're already dead."

"Then we're just making it permanent."

Dale spoke up. "In my grandfather's teachings, destroying bodies doesn't always destroy the spirit bound to a place. Might make them worse—untethered from physical limits."

"Noted," Ricky said. "Alternative: restraint. Bind them, contain them until we can leave or help arrives."

"Help's not coming," Denise said. "Nobody comes here by accident anymore. Only people the diner wants."

"Then we create our own help. Signal fire visible for miles. Smoke column during day. Someone sees it, investigates."

"Or it attracts them," Dale warned.

"Everything's a risk. We choose best available option."

Ricky continued planning aloud, working through scenarios:

**Scenario 1: They attack at night**
Response: Fortify position, fight from defensive stance, survive to dawn when supernatural weakens.

**Scenario 2: They attack at dawn**
Response: Engage aggressively, exploit their weakened state, attempt restraint.

**Scenario 3: They don't attack**
Response: We attack them. Take initiative, force confrontation on our terms.

"I don't like scenario three," Victor said.

"Neither do I. But waiting for them to strike gives them control. Initiative matters in combat."

Grace was taking notes. "What about the diner itself? Dale said it might be alive, conscious. Do we factor that into planning?"

"Building can't physically attack us. Worst case: locks doors, cuts lights, creates obstacles. We prepare for that—crowbars force locks, we have flashlights, we stay mobile. Building's tricks are psychological, not tactical."

He looked at each of them. "Questions?"

"Timing," Victor said. "When do we strike?"

"Sunrise tomorrow. Dale says thin places weaken at dawn. We exploit that window."

"That's twelve hours away."

"We spend that time preparing. Sharpen weapons, plan movements, memorize formations. Run drills. By sunrise, we're ready."

Dale shifted uncomfortably. "This feels wrong. We're planning to assault two elderly people."

"We're planning to stop two serial killers who've murdered thirty-seven people and will murder us if given opportunity. Age and appearance are camouflage."

"They might be victims too. Trapped like Denise."

"Doesn't change threat assessment. Sympathize later. Survive first."

Harsh, but true. Ricky had learned in Vietnam: hesitation kills. You can process morality after combat, not during.

Grace asked: "What's our endgame? We restrain Earl and Dotty, then what?"

"Repair vehicles, leave. Or signal for help, wait for authorities. Either way, we extract ourselves from this location."

"Denise can't leave."

Ricky met Denise's eyes. "We try anyway. Maybe restraining Earl and Dotty breaks the place's hold. Maybe it doesn't. But we try."

She nodded, hope fragile in her expression.

"Formation drills," Ricky announced. "Now. We practice until it's muscle memory."

They spent two hours rehearsing in the pre-dawn cold, breath fogging, fingers stiff on weapons.

Victor and Dale as Team A, practicing coordinated strikes with crowbar and tire iron. Ricky demonstrated: "High-low. Victor goes for head or shoulders, forces them to block high. Dale sweeps low, knees or legs. Alternate rhythm. Don't let them predict."

Victor swung the crowbar in slow motion. "Like this?"

"Faster. Earl won't move slow. Again."

They practiced the pattern. High strike, low strike, switch positions, repeat. Clumsy at first—Victor nearly clipped Dale's shoulder, Dale's timing off. But muscle memory built with repetition.

Ricky and Grace as Team B. Knife work was different—close quarters, intimate violence. Grace held the blade uncertainly.

"Not like that," Ricky said, adjusting her grip. "Blade down, edge out. Slash, don't stab. Stabbing gets your knife stuck in bone. Slashing opens arteries, creates damage, you can retract fast."

Grace's face was pale but determined. She practiced the motion—quick slash, step back, slash again. Creating distance while doing damage.

"Good. Now together. I engage, you circle behind. Two attackers, multiple angles. They can't defend everywhere at once."

Denise stood in protected center position, calling positions as Ricky instructed. "Earl at nine o'clock! Dotty flanking right!" Her voice gained strength with each call. Thirty years of passive witnessing transforming into active participation.

They weren't soldiers. Victor had trucker's strength and practical sense but his movements were heavy, telegraphed. Dale moved with desert-taught economy but lacked speed. Grace was quick and smart, adapted fast, but flinched from violence.

But they were learning. Ricky drilled them relentlessly.

By sunrise, they'd achieved basic competence. Not good. But better than nothing.

"Again," Ricky said. "From different approach angle."

They drilled in parking lot's dawn light. Earl and Dotty visible through diner windows, moving through breakfast prep. If they noticed the combat practice, they gave no sign.

"Faster," Ricky demanded. "Earl moves faster than this. Dotty's quicker. Speed matters."

Victor was breathing hard. Dale's age showed in slower reflexes. Grace's academic life hadn't prepared her for this. But they pushed through, improvement visible.

By full morning, Ricky called halt.

"Better. Not good, but better. Rest now. Eat, hydrate, maintain strength. Tonight we review plans. Tomorrow dawn, we execute."

They dispersed. Victor to check vehicles again, futile but occupying hands and mind. Grace to document more evidence, her camera a shield against fear. Dale to run another ground scan, finding comfort in mechanical precision. Denise to rest in the van's shade, exhausted by hope.

Ricky stayed in the parking lot, running solo drills. Knife work, movement patterns, strike-retreat-strike. Muscle memory from military training reasserting itself after years of civilian softness.

The sun climbed. Heat built. His shirt stuck to his back with sweat. But he kept drilling. In Vietnam, he'd learned that survival came down to preparation meeting opportunity. When the moment arrived, you didn't think—you executed trained responses or you died.

Tomorrow would be that moment.

A voice behind him: "You've done this before."

Grace, camera in hand. She'd been photographing him, documenting the preparation.

"Combat? Yeah. Different enemy, same principles."

"You think it'll work?"

"Honestly? Fifty-fifty odds. But that's better than waiting to be killed."

"I'm scared."

"Good. Fear keeps you sharp. Overconfidence kills." He wiped sweat. "You'll do fine. Good instincts—saw how fast you adapted."

"I've never hurt anyone."

"Neither had I, until I had to. Easier than you think when it's survival. Hard part comes after. But we deal with that later."

Grace lowered her camera. "What if we don't?"

"We will."

"Fifty-fifty isn't great odds."

"Fifty percent better than zero."

She photographed him practicing, documenting. Always documenting.

"If we die," she said, "these photos survive. Evidence that we tried."

"We're not dying."

"How do you know?"

"Because I survived two tours in hell and I'm not dying in a desert diner. Neither are you. Neither is anyone."

Conviction in his voice he almost believed.

Grace left him to his drills.

Ricky practiced until noon, then rested in shade. Sharpened his knife on Dale's whetstone. Checked formation positions again. Mentally rehearsed each scenario.

By evening, they gathered for final briefing behind the vehicles. The sun was setting, painting the desert orange and purple. The diner's neon sign would flicker on soon.

"Tomorrow, 0600 hours," Ricky said. "Dawn attack. We strike fast, hard, coordinated. Goal: restrain Earl and Dotty, secure the diner, signal for help. Questions?"

None. They all knew the plan. Had drilled it into muscle memory.

"Equipment check before sleep," Ricky continued. "Victor, crowbar and flashlight. Dale, tire iron and rope. Grace, knife and camera—document everything. I'll take primary knife and restraints. Denise, you stay center, call warnings, and if everything goes south, you run. Understood?"

"I'm not running," Denise said quietly. "Not anymore."

Ricky nodded. Didn't argue. She'd spent thirty years running and it never worked. Maybe tomorrow she'd find a different ending.

"Then get rest. Big day tomorrow."

They tried sleeping. None managed much.

Ricky lay awake in the truck bed, watching stars emerge. The desert night was cold and clear, constellations burning bright. He'd watched stars like this in Vietnam—through canopy gaps, wondering if each night was his last.

Tomorrow would decide everything. Either they'd stop Earl and Dotty, escape, get documentation to authorities. Or they'd join the thirty-seven in the freezer, become trophies on the wall.

He thought about the photo wall. All those victims. All those families.

Tomorrow, that ended.

He'd fought the living in jungle war. Tomorrow he'd fight the dead in desert trap.

Same principle: survive at any cost.

As false dawn grayed the eastern sky, Ricky checked his knife one final time. The blade was sharp, edge honed on Dale's whetstone. He tested the grip, the weight, the balance.

Ready.

He'd survived two tours in hell. He'd survive this.

Tomorrow, they'd take back control.

Or die trying.

He preferred the first option.

Significantly.
