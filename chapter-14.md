# Chapter 14: Ricky's Combat Planning

Pre-dawn. The coldest hour.

Ricky gathered them in a loose circle behind Dale's tow truck—Victor, Grace, Dale, Denise. Five civilians about to become combatants.

"Tactical situation," he began. Military brevity. "We have hostile forces occupying superior position with home-field advantage. We're outmatched in direct confrontation. Standard approach fails. We need asymmetric warfare."

Victor rubbed sleep from his eyes. "Speak English."

"We can't beat them in their territory using their rules. We change the game."

Ricky had spent the night planning. Combat theory applied to impossible circumstances. Not ideal, but workable.

"Enemy assessment," he continued. "Earl and Dotty. Physical capabilities enhanced beyond human normal—speed, strength, endurance. But Denise confirms they can be hurt, restrained. They're not invulnerable."

"They're dead," Grace pointed out.

"They're physical. That's what matters. Physical can be fought."

He outlined enemy patterns based on Denise's thirty years of observation:

**Earl:**
- Primary aggressor
- Uses meat hook
- Targets spine for immobilization
- Fast but predictable
- Stronger than appearance suggests

**Dotty:**
- Secondary attacker
- Uses kitchen knives
- Finishing strikes
- Faster than Earl
- More adaptable

"Standard MO: drug victims first via food. Wait for sedative effect. Attack when vulnerable."

"We haven't eaten their food in two days," Victor said.

"Correct. Which means if they attack, it's without that advantage. We'll be alert, capable of fighting back."

Ricky pulled out Dale's tire iron, Victor's crowbar, kitchen knives from the diner. Laid them like an armory.

"Weapons inventory. Not much, but enough. Distribution: Victor takes crowbar—reach advantage, uses his strength. Dale takes tire iron—similar. I take primary knife. Grace, secondary knife. Denise, you're non-combatant—stay behind us, call out warnings."

"I can fight," Denise said quietly.

"You've been traumatized for thirty years. Combat effectiveness compromised. No shame—just tactical reality."

She didn't argue.

Ricky drew formations in the sand with a stick. "We fight as unit. Two-person teams. Victor-Dale, me-Grace. Denise center, protected. Earl approaches, Victor-Dale engage. Dotty approaches, Grace and I engage. We don't separate, don't pursue, maintain formation."

"What if they attack together?" Grace asked.

"Then we focus fire. All weapons on one target until immobilized, then switch to second. Serial engagement instead of parallel."

Victor studied the sand diagrams. "You're talking about killing them."

"I'm talking about stopping them. If that requires lethal force, yes."

"They're already dead."

"Then we're just making it permanent."

Dale spoke up. "In my grandfather's teachings, destroying bodies doesn't always destroy the spirit bound to a place. Might make them worse—untethered from physical limits."

"Noted," Ricky said. "Alternative: restraint. Bind them, contain them until we can leave or help arrives."

"Help's not coming," Denise said. "Nobody comes here by accident anymore. Only people the diner wants."

"Then we create our own help. Signal fire visible for miles. Smoke column during day. Someone sees it, investigates."

"Or it attracts them," Dale warned.

"Everything's a risk. We choose best available option."

Ricky continued planning aloud, working through scenarios:

**Scenario 1: They attack at night**
Response: Fortify position, fight from defensive stance, survive to dawn when supernatural weakens.

**Scenario 2: They attack at dawn**
Response: Engage aggressively, exploit their weakened state, attempt restraint.

**Scenario 3: They don't attack**
Response: We attack them. Take initiative, force confrontation on our terms.

"I don't like scenario three," Victor said.

"Neither do I. But waiting for them to strike gives them control. Initiative matters in combat."

Grace was taking notes. "What about the diner itself? Dale said it might be alive, conscious. Do we factor that into planning?"

"Building can't physically attack us. Worst case: locks doors, cuts lights, creates obstacles. We prepare for that—crowbars force locks, we have flashlights, we stay mobile. Building's tricks are psychological, not tactical."

He looked at each of them. "Questions?"

"Timing," Victor said. "When do we strike?"

"Sunrise tomorrow. Dale says thin places weaken at dawn. We exploit that window."

"That's twelve hours away."

"We spend that time preparing. Sharpen weapons, plan movements, memorize formations. Run drills. By sunrise, we're ready."

Dale shifted uncomfortably. "This feels wrong. We're planning to assault two elderly people."

"We're planning to stop two serial killers who've murdered thirty-seven people and will murder us if given opportunity. Age and appearance are camouflage."

"They might be victims too. Trapped like Denise."

"Doesn't change threat assessment. Sympathize later. Survive first."

Harsh, but true. Ricky had learned in Vietnam: hesitation kills. You can process morality after combat, not during.

Grace asked: "What's our endgame? We restrain Earl and Dotty, then what?"

"Repair vehicles, leave. Or signal for help, wait for authorities. Either way, we extract ourselves from this location."

"Denise can't leave."

Ricky met Denise's eyes. "We try anyway. Maybe restraining Earl and Dotty breaks the place's hold. Maybe it doesn't. But we try."

She nodded, hope fragile in her expression.

"Formation drills," Ricky announced. "Now. We practice until it's muscle memory."

They spent two hours rehearsing. Victor and Dale as Team A, practicing coordinated strikes with crowbar and tire iron. Ricky and Grace as Team B, knife work—quick strikes, retreat, create openings. Denise in protected center, calling positions.

Clumsy at first. They weren't soldiers. But Victor had trucker's strength and practical sense. Dale moved with desert-taught economy. Grace was quick and smart, adapted fast. Denise's warnings were precise.

By sunrise, they'd achieved basic competence.

"Again," Ricky said. "From different approach angle."

They drilled in parking lot's dawn light. Earl and Dotty visible through diner windows, moving through breakfast prep. If they noticed the combat practice, they gave no sign.

"Faster," Ricky demanded. "Earl moves faster than this. Dotty's quicker. Speed matters."

Victor was breathing hard. Dale's age showed in slower reflexes. Grace's academic life hadn't prepared her for this. But they pushed through, improvement visible.

By full morning, Ricky called halt.

"Better. Not good, but better. Rest now. Eat, hydrate, maintain strength. Tonight we review plans. Tomorrow dawn, we execute."

They dispersed. Victor to check vehicles again, futile but occupying. Grace to document more evidence. Dale to run another ground scan. Denise to rest.

Ricky stayed in the parking lot, running solo drills. Knife work, movement patterns, strike-retreat-strike. Muscle memory from military training reasserting itself.

A voice behind him: "You've done this before."

Grace, camera in hand.

"Combat? Yeah. Different enemy, same principles."

"You think it'll work?"

"Honestly? Fifty-fifty odds. But that's better than waiting to be killed."

"I'm scared."

"Good. Fear keeps you sharp. Overconfidence kills."

She photographed him practicing, documenting. Always documenting.

"If we die," she said, "these photos survive. Evidence that we tried."

"We're not dying."

"How do you know?"

"Because I survived two tours in hell and I'm not dying in a desert diner. Neither are you. Neither is anyone."

Conviction in his voice he almost believed.

Grace left him to his drills.

Ricky practiced until noon, then rested in shade. Sharpened his knife on Dale's whetstone. Checked formation positions again. Mentally rehearsed each scenario.

By evening, they gathered for final briefing.

"Tomorrow, 0600 hours," Ricky said. "Dawn attack. We strike fast, hard, coordinated. Goal: restrain Earl and Dotty, secure the diner, signal for help. Questions?"

None.

"Then get rest. Big day tomorrow."

They tried sleeping. None managed much.

Ricky lay awake in the truck bed, watching stars. Thinking about Vietnam, about survival, about the thin line between living and becoming a ghost.

He'd fought the living before.

Tomorrow he'd fight the dead.

Same principle applied: survive at any cost.

As false dawn grayed the eastern sky, Ricky checked his knife one final time.

Tomorrow, they'd take back control.

Or die trying.

He preferred the first option.
