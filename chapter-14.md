# Chapter 14: Ricky's Combat Planning

Pre-dawn. The coldest hour.

Ricky gathered them in a loose circle behind Dale's tow truck—Victor, Grace, Dale, Denise. Five civilians about to become combatants.

"Tactical situation," he began. Military brevity. "We have hostile forces occupying superior position with home-field advantage. We're outmatched in direct confrontation. Standard approach fails. We need asymmetric warfare."

Victor rubbed sleep from his eyes. "Speak English."

"We can't beat them in their territory using their rules. We change the game."

Ricky had spent the night planning. Combat theory applied to impossible circumstances. Not ideal, but workable.

"Enemy assessment," he continued. "Earl and Dotty. Physical capabilities enhanced beyond human normal—speed, strength, endurance. But Denise confirms they can be hurt, restrained. They're not invulnerable."

"They're dead," Grace pointed out.

"They're physical. That's what matters. Physical can be fought."

He outlined enemy patterns based on Denise's thirty years of observation:

**Earl:**
- Primary aggressor
- Uses meat hook
- Targets spine for immobilization
- Fast but predictable
- Stronger than appearance suggests

**Dotty:**
- Secondary attacker
- Uses kitchen knives
- Finishing strikes
- Faster than Earl
- More adaptable

"Standard MO: drug victims first via food. Wait for sedative effect. Attack when vulnerable."

"We haven't eaten their food in two days," Victor said.

"Correct. Which means if they attack, it's without that advantage. We'll be alert, capable of fighting back."

Ricky pulled out Dale's tire iron, Victor's crowbar, kitchen knives from the diner. Laid them like an armory.

"Weapons inventory. Not much, but enough. Distribution: Victor takes crowbar—reach advantage, uses his strength. Dale takes tire iron—similar. I take primary knife. Grace, secondary knife. Denise, you're non-combatant—stay behind us, call out warnings."

"I can fight," Denise said quietly.

"You've been traumatized for thirty years. Combat effectiveness compromised. No shame—just tactical reality."

She didn't argue.

Ricky drew formations in the sand with a stick. "We fight as unit. Two-person teams. Victor-Dale, me-Grace. Denise center, protected. Earl approaches, Victor-Dale engage. Dotty approaches, Grace and I engage. We don't separate, don't pursue, maintain formation."

"What if they attack together?" Grace asked.

"Then we focus fire. All weapons on one target until immobilized, then switch to second. Serial engagement instead of parallel."

Victor studied the sand diagrams. "You're talking about killing them."

"I'm talking about stopping them. If that requires lethal force, yes."

"They're already dead."

"Then we're just making it permanent."

Dale spoke up. "In my grandfather's teachings, destroying bodies doesn't always destroy the spirit bound to a place. Might make them worse—untethered from physical limits."

"Noted," Ricky said. "Alternative: restraint. Bind them, contain them until we can leave or help arrives."

"Help's not coming," Denise said. "Nobody comes here by accident anymore. Only people the diner wants."

"Then we create our own help. Signal fire visible for miles. Smoke column during day. Someone sees it, investigates."

"Or it attracts them," Dale warned.

"Everything's a risk. We choose best available option."

Ricky continued planning aloud, working through scenarios:

**Scenario 1: They attack at night**
Response: Fortify position, fight from defensive stance, survive to dawn when supernatural weakens.

**Scenario 2: They attack at dawn**
Response: Engage aggressively, exploit their weakened state, attempt restraint.

**Scenario 3: They don't attack**
Response: We attack them. Take initiative, force confrontation on our terms.

"I don't like scenario three," Victor said.

"Neither do I. But waiting for them to strike gives them control. Initiative matters in combat."

Grace was taking notes. "What about the diner itself? Dale said it might be alive, conscious. Do we factor that into planning?"

"Building can't physically attack us. Worst case: locks doors, cuts lights, creates obstacles. We prepare for that—crowbars force locks, we have flashlights, we stay mobile. Building's tricks are psychological, not tactical."

He looked at each of them. "Questions?"

"Timing," Victor said. "When do we strike?"

"Sunrise tomorrow. Dale says thin places weaken at dawn. We exploit that window."

"That's twelve hours away."

"We spend that time preparing. Sharpen weapons, plan movements, memorize formations. Run drills. By sunrise, we're ready."

Dale shifted uncomfortably. "This feels wrong. We're planning to assault two elderly people."

"We're planning to stop two serial killers who've murdered thirty-seven people and will murder us if given opportunity. Age and appearance are camouflage."

"They might be victims too. Trapped like Denise."

"Doesn't change threat assessment. Sympathize later. Survive first."

Harsh, but true. Ricky had learned in Vietnam: hesitation kills. You can process morality after combat, not during.

Grace asked: "What's our endgame? We restrain Earl and Dotty, then what?"

"Repair vehicles, leave. Or signal for help, wait for authorities. Either way, we extract ourselves from this location."

"Denise can't leave."

Ricky met Denise's eyes. "We try anyway. Maybe restraining Earl and Dotty breaks the place's hold. Maybe it doesn't. But we try."

She nodded, hope fragile in her expression.

"We prepare tonight," Ricky said. "Get everything ready. Tomorrow dawn, we execute."

They spent the night preparing. Each person found purpose in action.

Ricky sharpened knives methodically. Dale's whetstone against steel, rhythmic scraping in the desert night. He tested each edge against his thumb—not hard enough to cut, just feeling the keenness. Kitchen knives weren't combat blades, but sharp was sharp. In Vietnam he'd seen men killed with broken bottles, with sharpened sticks, with bare hands when it came to it. It was the wielder, not the weapon. He worked the blade at precise angles, muscle memory from a hundred nights on firebase perimeters. The familiar routine calmed him.

Victor tested restraints. Electrical wire from his truck, thick gauge copper. He wrapped it around booth fixtures, pulled hard, checked integrity. Strong enough to hold a man—even a supernatural one. Maybe. He'd learned knot-tying in the Army, practiced until his hands remembered. Bowline, clove hitch, square knot. Muscle memory from decades past.

Grace documented everything. Her Pentax clicking methodically. Photos of weapons laid out. Photos of the group planning. Photos of the diner from outside, Earl and Dotty visible through windows. Evidence. Always evidence. If they died tomorrow, someone would find her film. Someone would know what happened here.

Dale prayed quietly. Not Christian prayer—older words in Laguna, his grandfather's language. Asking protection, asking guidance, asking forgiveness for violence about to come. He burned sage he kept in the truck, let smoke drift over weapons. Blessing or ritual or psychological comfort—didn't matter which. It steadied his hands.

Denise trembled. Sat in the van wrapped in a blanket despite the heat, watching them prepare. Thirty years of helplessness ending tomorrow. Either freedom or death. Both terrified her equally.

Outside, Earl whistled. Same tune he'd been whistling for days—some big band number from the forties. Cheerful, incongruous. Like he knew what they were planning. Like he wasn't concerned.

Maybe he wasn't. Sixty years of this. Sixty years of travelers planning escapes, planning fights, planning resistance. All of them dead now. All of them in the freezer or buried in the desert.

But none of them had known what Earl and Dotty were. None had prepared. None had weapons and evidence and tactical plans.

Ricky hoped that mattered.

The night stretched. Hours passing in tense silence broken only by whetstone scraping, wire testing, camera clicking, prayer murmuring. Nobody slept. Tomorrow would bring violence—first they'd faced in this place, first they'd chosen rather than endured.

Ricky mentally rehearsed scenarios. Earl attacks from the left—Victor blocks with crowbar, Ricky strikes from behind. Dotty flanks—Grace intercepts, Dale supports. Both attack together—form defensive circle, Denise protected center. Serial engagement, maintain formation, don't separate.

Combat theory. Whether it worked against the already-dead remained to be seen.

By evening, they gathered for final briefing behind the vehicles. The sun was setting, painting the desert orange and purple. The diner's neon sign would flicker on soon.

"Tomorrow, 0600 hours," Ricky said. "Dawn attack. We strike fast, hard, coordinated. Goal: restrain Earl and Dotty, secure the diner, signal for help. Questions?"

None. They all knew the plan. Had drilled it into muscle memory.

"Equipment check before sleep," Ricky continued. "Victor, crowbar and flashlight. Dale, tire iron and rope. Grace, knife and camera—document everything. I'll take primary knife and restraints. Denise, you stay center, call warnings, and if everything goes south, you run. Understood?"

"I'm not running," Denise said quietly. "Not anymore."

Ricky nodded. Didn't argue. She'd spent thirty years running and it never worked. Maybe tomorrow she'd find a different ending.

"Then get rest. Big day tomorrow."

They tried sleeping. None managed much.

Ricky lay awake in the truck bed, watching stars emerge. The desert night was cold and clear, constellations burning bright. He'd watched stars like this in Vietnam—through canopy gaps, wondering if each night was his last.

Tomorrow would decide everything. Either they'd stop Earl and Dotty, escape, get documentation to authorities. Or they'd join the thirty-seven in the freezer, become trophies on the wall.

He thought about the photo wall. All those victims. All those families.

Tomorrow, that ended.

He'd fought the living in jungle war. Tomorrow he'd fight the dead in desert trap.

Same principle: survive at any cost.

As false dawn grayed the eastern sky, Ricky checked his knife one final time. The blade was sharp, edge honed on Dale's whetstone. He tested the grip, the weight, the balance.

Ready.

He'd survived two tours in hell. He'd survive this.

Tomorrow, they'd take back control.

Or die trying.

He preferred the first option.

Significantly.
